\section{Surveys}

\section{The A-PLUS survey}

\section{The J-PAS survey}

\chapter{The southern A-PLUS telescope}

In this chapter we describe the design and the installation of the Brazilian counterpart of the 86 cm telescope installed on Teruel. The T80S telescope is a \textbf{ improve this} founded project by the Brazilian institutions IAG, ON and LNA. The main objective for building the telescope is to carry two surveys the A-PLUS and the S-POL. The A-PLUS will be a photometric survey on the southern hemisphere \textbf{ meter figura da area} on twelve optical filters \textbf{ TODO meter tabela e curavs}. The S-POL (tbd).

\section{T80S installations}
The T80-South telescope is situated near the summit of Cerro Tololo in central Chile, at an altitude of 2,207 m, at latitude -30:10:10.78 and longitude -70:48:23.49. It is installed on a small building with the dome, a small data center for data processing and two auxiliary rooms for instrument engineering purposes. The operation of the telescope is designed to be fully automated and it is controlled by the observatory control system (OCS) developed by our team \textbf{explain better} since 2008. More details of the OCS will be described on \ref{sec:chimera}.

\subsection{Telescope}

The T80S is a new generation of Ritchey-Chretien Cassegrain telescopes with a huge field of view (FoV) of 2 square degrees. The design of telescopes with such FoVs are crucial to conduct astromical surveys as it allows to cover huge areas on the sky with relatively small amounts of time. The telescope design was developed by Advanced Mechanical and Optical Systems (AMOS) in Li√®ge, Belgium with the mechanical fabrication, assembly and control systems subcontracted to the German company ASTELCO Systems GmbH in Munich. The telescope control is done via a private protocol called OpenTPL developed by Tau-Tec GmbH. More details on the control of the telescope are explained on section \ref{sec:chimera}.

The telescope detailed optical parameters are shown on table \ref{tab:t80s_optics}.

The alignment of the secondary mirror with respect of the primary mirror needs to be done on each pointing due the large FoV area. The telescope center of mass and temperature changes the alignment, so a simple model was implemented by 

\subsection{Instrument}

On both photometric and polarimetric mode, T80S will use a Spectral Instruments 1100S camera equipped with an E2V 290-99-1-F24 CCD (serial number 11323-24-01). This CCD is mounted on the focal plane with a filter+shutter unit (FSU) \textbf{ figure here!} between it and the telescope flange. The filter shutter unit is composed of a custom-made shutter by Bonn Shutters and filter wheels with their motors and encoders according the observation model (polarimetric or photometric).

The mechanical part of the FSU was designed at Instituto de Pesquisas Espaciais, in Brazil, and produced by MetalCard. The control of the FSU was designed by another Brazilian company Solunia using Programable Logic Controllers PLCs from Beckhoff.

On the photometric mode, the FSU counts with two filter wheels with 7 positions each (6 filters plus 1 clear position) and it also hosts a guiding camera at the border of the focal plane which is not used at the moment since the telescope tracking is sufficiently accurate for the exposure times of the survey \textbf{ cite table survey exposure times}.

\textbf{ TODO: EXPAND ON THIS On the polarimetric mode, the FSU counts with one filter wheel, one polarimetric wheel which spins a crystal of calcite, giving the required polarization phase for each exposure and one ???}

\subsection{Data center}

The data center was designed to store the brute data from the observations and to have the computing capacity to reduce online the data which is being acquired by the camera. It is located on the Technical Room on figure \textbf{figure map telescope}.

Having the pipeline being executed online together with the observations facilitate the survey scheduling, making decisions that minimizes the survey time minimizing the number of fields that must be re-visited.

The data center counts with one router and one switch for network communications together with 5 servers: three application servers (APP), one camera server (CAM) and one storage server (STO). There is a sixth server which is located on La Serena city, at CTIO headquarters, which will store the data backup. An detailed list of hardware is shown on table \ref{tab:t80s_datacenter}

\subsection{Chimera: The T80S OCS}
\label{sec:chimera}

Every operation of the T80S telescope is controlled by a fully-distributed software called chimera\footnote{\url{http://github.com/astroufsc/chimera/}}. Developed in Python, it uses Python Remote Objects\footnote{\url{http://www.pythonhosted.org/Pyro/}} as technology to distribute objects across the different computers and operational systems. Since its dependencies are very low, chimera haves the advantage to run on many flavours of operational systems such Windows, Linux and even Andriod letting the implementations be easily ported from one architecture to another one.

Chimera is designed in three main layers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Core: The core of chimera holds all the common methods for all chimera modules such as low end communication methods to translate PYRO objects into chimera objects and basic astronomical-related methods like coordinates conversions and file names creations and events control

\item Instrument drivers provide the abstraction from the hardware particular characteristics implementing common methods across all the instruments of a specific type. With this approach, every instrument haves a common inteface with methods and events which some are mandatory and some optional. For example, for a Telescope method, a 

\item Controllers are the high level interfaces operating on the instruments through their standard methods to do all the
inherent tasks to an astronomical observatory.

\chapter{A method to measure stellar properties of galaxies from redshift templates}



In this chapter we introduce a new method which combines the output of a bayesian  photometric redshift code with a stellar population analysis to estimate basic galaxy properties like its stellar mass $M_\star$.
We start by describing the BPZ code of \cite{Benitez.2000a} on section \ref{sec:bpz} and on section \ref{sec:fit}, we introduce our method to derive the stellar populations parameters from the output redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs).


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

The main motivation of the work described in this chapter is to have a robust method for determining stellar masses ($M_\star$) out of photometric data alone, without relying on any spectroscopic information. As explained in the introduction to this thesis, photometric surveys like DES (REF), JPAS (REF), LSST (REF) and many others are one of the main sources of data for observational cosmology and extragalactric astrophysics nowadays. Most of these mega-surveys aim to use the data to estimate galaxy redshifts and address cosmological questions like the nature of dark energy. However, it would certainly be positive/smart to use these same data to learn more about galaxies than their mere redshifts. This is the central motivation of the work presented in this chapter.


Many previous studies used photometry to estimate $M_\star$, like REFS.....
All of these, however, make use of a spectroscopic $z$ to map the observed filter on the galaxy frame and to calculate the objects luminosity, which is then combined with a stellar mass-to-light ratio to determine $M_\star$. Taylor2011, for instance, builds an extensive library of model galaxy spectra, from which photometric fluxes are computed... ugriz... DEIXAR CLARO ONDE ENTRA O z PRO TAYLOR!


When spectroscopic redshifts are not available
This approach is certainly the 

....


Photometric redshifts are the cheapest and fastest way for the determination of the distance of galaxies. The precision of these distances is undeniably smaller that the spectroscopic ones but the number of galaxies that can be covered with the same amount of telescope time and the use of the redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) are shown to be very powerful when the goal is to have a statistical sample.

Also it was shown by many authors \textbf{(cite..)} that using a simple estimator like the maximum likelihood or the likelihood average leads the results to significant biases so any method that rely on photometric redshifts should take in account the full probability distribution function. The survey selection functions of photometric surveys are usually much simpler than of the spectroscopic surveys, facilitating the account for selection biases on stellar and luminosity function easier.

The non-dependence of spectral redshifts opens our method to a much larger survey datasets and will enable us to have robust stellar masses probability distribution functions to any photometric redshift survey such as DES and JPAS.

So, what 





\section{Bayesian photometric redshifts: The BPZ method}
\label{sec:bpz}

\begin{figure}
\begin{adjustwidth*}{1in}{0pt}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/bpz_templates.pdf}
\end{adjustwidth*}
\caption{aa}
\label{fig:bpz_templates}
\end{figure}

For the photometric redshift calculations, we use the bayesian photometric redshift code BPZ \citep{Benitez.2000a}. BPZ calculates the probability distribution function (PDF) of the objects being on a redshift $z_i$ and of a spectral type $T_j$.

The redshift probability $p(z_i, T_j|D_l,I)$ for $z_i$ to be the true redshift and $T_j$ be the spectral type of a given observed galaxy with $N_l$ observed fluxes/magnitudes ($D = m_l$, or more conveniently $D = \vec{C}, m_0$ where $\vec{C} = \{m_1 - m0, m_2 - m_0, \ldots\}$ represent the colors between an apparent magnitude $m_0$ and the others)  can be written as:
\begin{equation}
p(z_i,T_j|\vec{C}, m_0,  I) = \frac{p(\vec{C}, m_0|z_i,T_j,I) \times p(z_i, T_j|I)}{p(\vec{C}, m_0|I)}
\end{equation}

Accordingly to the Bayes theorem, the left side of the equation is called hypothesis and, on the right side, we have the redshift likelihood times the prior on the numerator and the denominator is the evidence. Since we are just interested on the estimation of the redshift, the evidence turns into an ordinary normalization constant \citep{Sivia.Skilling.2006}.

!!!! explain that y'cause you analyse templates you do it once and then only use the reulst...


The redshift likelihood $p(\vec{C}, m_0|z_i,T_j,I)$ can be written as:

\begin{equation}
p(\vec{C}, m_0|z_i,T_j,I) = e^{-\frac{\chi_{ij}^2}{2}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\chi^2$ is given by the sum over all photometric filters $l = 1, \ldots N_l$ of the quadratic difference between the $i$-th template to the observed flux $f^T_{ij}$ or magnitude $m^T_{ij}$.

So, in case of the $\chi^2$ in fluxes, we have:

\begin{equation}
\chi^2_{i,j} = \sum_l \left( {f^O_l}^2 - a_{i,j} {f^T_{l,i,j}}^2 \right) w^2_l
\end{equation}

\noindent where $a$ is a template normalization factor which can be calculated by minimizing the $\chi^2$ value. The $w_l$ is a weight factor which is essentially dependent of the error in the observed magnitude, e.g. $w_l = \frac{1}{\sigma_l}$. \footnote{This weight can be changed to accommodate, for example, templates with intrinsic errors, error scaling factors, etc...}

It can be easily shown that for magnitudes this scaling factor $a_j$ becomes an additive factor, making the magnitude $\chi^2$ in the form:

\begin{equation}
\chi^2_{i,j} = \sum_l \left( {m^O_l}^2 - {m^T_{l,i,j} + A_{i,j}}^2 \right) w^2_l
\end{equation}

The first term on the right side of the equation, the template-redshift prior, is used to modulate the evidence in the form that unrealistic template, redshift and apparent magnitude combinations are less taken in account than more realistic ones. In pratice, two effects are taken in account on this prior: galaxies cannot be too far if they are too bright (i.e. low apparent magnitude $m_0$) and galaxies average colors must be slightly bluer as redhifts increases. This prior distribution is empirically calibrated using colors and spectroscopic redshifts for the Hubble Deep Field North. For more details on the empirical redshift prior distribution, we invite the reader to give a look on \cite{Benitez.2000a}. On figure \ref{fig:prior} \textbf{from benitez e tal, etc..}, the two effects are shown. On the upper panel, we have an example of what would be a redshift likelihood for the different spectral types. On the second panel, the prior is shown with the characteristics metioned before and, on the third and fourth panels the final redshift PDF. Note that if a flat prior were assumed, the most likely redshift for the galaxy would be around 2.8 but, after applying the prior distribution, this peak goes back to around 0.3.

\section{Template expansion: A convenient trick}
\label{sec:TemplateExpansion}


\section{From redshift PDFs to stellar properties PDFs}
\label{sec:fit}

Given a stellar population spectrum which we denote $S_k$ which is a spectrum composed by a model with $\vec{\theta}_k$ parameters, one can write the probability of this stellar populations parameters be the parameters that reproduce the galaxy colors $\vec{C}$ and apparent magnitude $m_0$ as:

\begin{equation}
p(\vec{\theta}_k | \vec{C}, m_0)
\end{equation}

if we want to, at the same time, calculate the PDF of the same galaxy to have stellar properties $\vec{\theta}_k$, redshift $z_i$ and be of the spectral type of $T_j$, we can add up the $z_i$ and $T_j$ terms in the form:

\begin{equation}
p(\vec{\theta}_k, z_i, T_j | \vec{C}, m_0) = p(z_i, T_j|\vec{C}, m_0)p(\vec{\theta}_k|z_i,T_j,\vec{C},m_0)
\end{equation}

\noindent where the right term is given only by the probability product chain rule. \textbf{check this name}

Since there is no dependence on $\vec{C}, m_0$ with $\vec{\theta}_k$, we rewrite the equation as

\begin{equation}
p(\vec{\theta}_k, z_i, T_j | \vec{C}, m_0) = p(z_i, T_j|\vec{C}, m_0)p(\vec{\theta}_k|z_i,T_j)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p(z_i, T_j|\vec{C}, m_0)$ is the template-redshift probability distribution function given by BPZ (or any other probabilistic photometric redshift code) which is described on section \ref{sec:bpz} and the stellar population PDF is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stellar_pop_props}
p(\vec{\theta}_k|z_i,T_j) \propto p_I(\vec{\theta}) p(T_j|\vec{\theta}_k, z_i)
\end{equation}

Assuming a flat prior will incur that the prior will be dominated by the sampling on $\vec{\theta}_k$ space, therefore $p_I (\vec{\theta}_k) = \delta \vec{\theta}_k$ and the likelihood defined by:

\begin{equation}
p(T_j|\vec{\theta}_k, z_i) = \mathcal{L}_{i,j,k} = \exp \left( \frac{1}{\sum_l m^S_k - m^T_{i,j} + A_{i,j,k}} \right)
\end{equation}

where $A_{i,j,k}$, as mentioned on sec. \ref{sec:bpz} is a mere minimization constant and, for our pourposes, will be neglected as it haves no practical meaning.

To describe in a more practical way, we arranged all the steps involved on the estimation of the stellar properties such as stellar mass of a galaxy with a template-redshift $p(z_i, T_j|\vec{C}, m_0)$.

The pre-processing steps on the BPZ templates done are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Remove BPZ emission lines: To compare stelllar population models with BPZ templates, the BPZ emission lines must be removed. On figure \ref{fig:bpz_templates} we draw the 11 BPZ templates marking in red the emission lines that were removed from spectra.

\item Interpolate BPZ templates: The emission line free templates are lineary interpolated between them 3 times as it is done on BPZ so, for each redshift bin, there is 41 templates.

\item For each $(i, j)$ pair on the template-redshift space, evaluate the template magnitudes $m^T_{i,j}$ for the filters of the survey we are going to measure the properties.

\end{itemize}

This BPZ template magnitudes $m^T_{i,j}$ are going to be fit by a set of random composite stellar populations \textbf{(define parameters of the CSPs)} \ref{tab:ListOfParameters}. To speed up the PDF calculation, we used the emcee code \citep{ForemanMackey.etal.2013a} to map the probability space on regions where the probability is not so negligible. The emcee code is a Python code that implements the affine-invariant ensamble sampler for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We randomly initialize 70 walkers and sample the parameter space looking for a set of most probable likelihoods. To achieve that, we run each walker for 3000 steps, removing the first 1000 steps as burn-in phase. Visual inspection of the chains was done to make sure this burn-in phase was met.

%From the remaining steps, we evaluate fine (1000 steps) histograms on all properties. The result is a likelihood array $\p(\vec{\theta}|z_i, T_j)$ with dimension $N_z, N_T, 1000$ which, combined with the photometric redshift $p(z_i,T_j|\vec{C}, m_0)$ on equation \ref{eq:stellar_pop_props} will give us the stellar properties.
