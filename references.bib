	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {Our goal is to study the evolution of the $B-$band luminosity function (LF) since $z=1$ using ALHAMBRA data. We used the photometric redshift and the $I-$band selection magnitude probability distribution functions (PDFs) of those ALHAMBRA galaxies with $I\leq24$ mag to compute the posterior LF. We statistically studied quiescent and star-forming galaxies using the template information encoded in the PDFs. The LF covariance matrix in redshift-magnitude-galaxy type space was computed, including the cosmic variance. That was estimated from the intrinsic dispersion of the LF measurements in the 48 ALHAMBRA sub-fields. The uncertainty due to the photometric redshift prior is also included in our analysis. We modelled the LF with a redshift-dependent Schechter function affected by the same selection effects than the data. The measured ALHAMBRA LF at $0.2\leq z<1$ and the evolving Schechter parameters both for quiescent and star-forming galaxies agree with previous results in the literature. The estimated redshift evolution of $M_B^* \propto Qz$ is $Q_{\rm SF}=-1.03\pm0.08$ and $Q_{\rm Q}=-0.80\pm0.08$, and of $\log \phi^* \propto Pz$ is $P_{\rm SF}=-0.01\pm0.03$ and $P_{\rm Q}=-0.41\pm0.05$. The measured faint-end slopes are $\alpha_{\rm SF}=-1.29\pm0.02$ and $\alpha_{\rm Q}=-0.53\pm0.04$. We find a significant population of faint quiescent galaxies, modelled by a second Schechter function with slope $\beta=-1.31\pm0.11$. We find a factor $2.55\pm0.14$ decrease in the luminosity density $j_B$ of star-forming galaxies, and a factor $1.25\pm0.16$ increase in the $j_B$ of quiescent ones since $z=1$, confirming the continuous build-up of the quiescent population with cosmic time. The contribution of the faint quiescent population to $j_B$ increases from 3% at $z=1$ to 6% at $z=0$. The developed methodology will be applied to future multi-filter surveys such as J-PAS.},

@article{Bell.etal.2003a,
	Abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Omega*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

	Abstract = {Stellar masses play a crucial role in the exploration of galaxy properties and the evolution of the galaxy population. In this paper, we explore the minimum possible uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light ratios (M */L) from the assumed star formation history (SFH) and metallicity distribution, with the goals of providing a minimum set of requirements for observational studies. We use a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy spectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of M */L values using either absorption-line data or broadband colors. The accuracy of M */L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices in combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with intermediate-age or young stellar populations. While M */L accuracy clearly depends on the spectral S/N, there is no significant gain in improving the S/N much above 50 pixel-1 and limiting uncertainties of ~0.03 dex are reached. Assuming that dust is accurately corrected or absent and that the redshift is known, color-based M */L estimates are only slightly more uncertain than spectroscopic estimates (at comparable spectroscopic and photometric quality), but are more easily affected by systematic biases. This is the case in particular for galaxies with bursty SFHs (high Hdelta A  at fixed D4000 n ), the M */L of which cannot be constrained any better than ~0.15 dex with any indicators explored here. Finally, we explore the effects of the assumed prior distribution in SFHs and metallicity, finding them to be higher for color-based estimates.},

	Abstract = {Twilight/night sky images are often used for flat-fielding CCD images, but the brightness gradient in twilight/ night sky causes problems of accurate flat-field correction in astronomical images for wide-field telescopes. Using data from the Antarctic Survey Telescope (AST3), we found that when the sky brightness gradient is minimum and stable, there is still a gradient of 1% across AST3's field-of-view of 4.3 square degrees. We tested various approaches to remove the varying gradients in individual flat-field images. Our final optimal method can reduce the spatially dependent errors caused by the gradient to the negligible level. We also suggest a guideline of flat-fielding using twilight/night sky images for wide-field robotic autonomous telescopes.},

	Abstract = {We present redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 imaging data. We used the nearest-neighbor weighting algorithm to derive the ensemble redshift distribution N(z), and individual redshift probability distributions P(z) for galaxies with r < 21.8 and u < 29.0. As part of this technique, we calculated weights for a set of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their density distribution in five-dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional to that of the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that space. We estimated the ensemble N(z) of the photometric sample by constructing a weighted histogram of the training-set redshifts. We derived P(z)'s for individual objects by using training-set objects from the local color-magnitude space around each photometric object. Using the P(z) for each galaxy can reduce the statistical error in measurements that depend on the redshifts of individual galaxies. The spectroscopic training sample is substantially larger than that used for the DR7 release. The newly added PRIMUS catalog is now the most important training set used in this analysis by a wide margin. We expect the primary sources of error in the N(z) reconstruction to be sample variance and spectroscopic failures: The training sets are drawn from relatively small volumes of space, and some samples have large incompleteness. Using simulations we estimated the uncertainty in N(z) due to sample variance at a given redshift to be ~10%-15%. The uncertainty on calculations incorporating N(z) or P(z) depends on how they are used; we discuss the case of weak lensing measurements. The P(z) catalog is publicly available from the SDSS Web site.},

	Abstract = {Precision photometric redshifts will be essential for extracting cosmological parameters from the next generation of wide-area imaging surveys. In this paper, we introduce a photometric redshift algorithm, ArborZ, based on the machine-learning technique of boosted decision trees. We study the algorithm using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and from mock catalogs intended to simulate both the SDSS and the upcoming Dark Energy Survey. We show that it improves upon the performance of existing algorithms. Moreover, the method naturally leads to the reconstruction of a full probability density function (PDF) for the photometric redshift of each galaxy, not merely a single "best estimate" and error, and also provides a photo-z quality figure of merit for each galaxy that can be used to reject outliers. We show that the stacked PDFs yield a more accurate reconstruction of the redshift distribution N(z). We discuss limitations of the current algorithm and ideas for future work.},

	Abstract = {We present the Zurich Extragalactic Bayesian Redshift Analyzer (ZEBRA). The current version of ZEBRA combines and extends several of the classical approaches to produce accurate photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes. In particular, ZEBRA uses the template-fitting approach to produce Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian redshift estimates based on the following points.  (i) An automatic iterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to best represent the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of real galaxies at different redshifts. (ii) A training set of spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample to improve the robustness of the photometric redshift estimates. (iii) An iterative technique for Bayesian redshift estimates, which extracts the full two-dimensional redshift and template probability function for each galaxy. We demonstrate the performance of ZEBRA by applying it to a sample of 866 IAB <= 22.5 COSMOS galaxies with available u*, B, V, g', r', i', z' and Ks photometry and zCOSMOS spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0 < z < 1.3. Adopting a 5sigma clipping that excludes <=10 galaxies, both the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian ZEBRA estimates for this sample have an accuracy sigmaDeltaz/(1+ z) smaller than 0.03. Similar accuracies are recovered using mock galaxies.  ZEBRA is made available at http://www.exp-astro.phys.ethz.ch/ZEBRA.},

@article{Arnouts.etal.1999a,
	Abstract = {The evolution of galaxy clustering from z=0 to z~=4.5 is analysed using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than IAB<=28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North. The reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving correlation length r0 has a small decrease in the range 0<~z<~1 followed by an increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of Cold Dark Matter scenarios, including Einstein-de Sitter models, an open model and a flat model with non-zero cosmological constant. Comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de Sitter universe, we obtain b~=2.5 at z~=2 and b~=5 at z~=4. These results support theoretical scenarios of biased galaxy formation in which the galaxies observed at high redshift are preferentially located in more massive haloes. Moreover, they suggest that the usual parameterization of the clustering evolution as xi(r,z)=xi(r,0)(1+z)-(3+ε) is not a good description for any value of ε. Comparison of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z~=3 with those reported by Adelberger et al. and Giavalisco et al., based on a different selection, suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at z~=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted in the frame of the various cosmologies considered here. At z~=4, the strong clustering observed in the Hubble Deep Field requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.},

	Abstract = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

	Abstract = {Our aim in this work is to answer, using simulated narrow-band photometry data, the following general question: What can we learn about galaxies from these new generation cosmological surveys? For instance, can we estimate stellar age and metallicity distributions? Can we separate star-forming galaxies from AGN? Can we measure emission lines, nebular abundances and extinction? With what precision? To accomplish this, we selected a sample of about 300k galaxies with good S/N from the SDSS and divided them in two groups: 200k objects and a template library of 100k. We corrected the spectra to z = 0 and converted them to filter fluxes. Using a statistical approach, we calculated a Probability Distribution Function (PDF) for each property of each object and the library. Since we have the properties of all the data from the STARLIGHT-SDSS database, we could compare them with the results obtained from summaries of the PDF (mean, median, etc). Our results shows that we retrieve the weighted average of the log of the galaxy age with a good error margin (sigma ≈ 0.1 - 0.2 dex), and similarly for the physical properties such as mass-to-light ratio, mean stellar metallicity, etc. Furthermore, our main result is that we can derive emission line intensities and ratios with similar precision. This makes this method unique in comparison to the other methods on the market to analyze photometry data and shows that, from the point of view of galaxy studies, future photometric surveys will be much more useful than anticipated.},

	Abstract = {Astronomical seeing is quantified by a single parameter, the turbulence integral, in the framework of the Kolmogorov turbulence model. This parameter can be routinely measured by a Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM). A new instrument, the multi-aperture scintillation sensor (MASS), permits one to measure the seeing in the free atmosphere above ~0.5km and, together with a DIMM, to estimate the ground-layer seeing. The absolute accuracy of both methods is studied here using analytical theory, numerical simulation and experiments. A modification of the MASS data processing to compensate for partially saturated scintillation is developed. We find that the DIMM can be severely biased by optical aberrations (e.g. defocus) and propagation. Seeing measurements with DIMM and MASS can reach absolute accuracy of ~10 per cent when their biases are carefully controlled. Pushing this limit to 1 per cent appears unrealistic because the seeing itself is just a model-dependent parameter of a non-stationary random process.},

@article{CidFernandes.etal.2001a,
	Abstract = {We revisit the classical problem of synthesizing spectral properties of a galaxy by using a base of star clusters, approaching it from a probabilistic perspective. The problem consists of estimating the population vector x, composed by the contributions of n* different base elements to the integrated spectrum of a galaxy, and the extinction AV, given a set of absorption line equivalent widths and continuum colours. The formalism is applied to the base of 12 elements defined by Schmidt et al.Q1 as corresponding to the principal components of the original base employed by BicaQ1, and subsequently used in several studies of the stellar populations of galaxies. The exploration of the 13D parameter space is carried out with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme, based on the Metropolis algorithm. This produces a smoother and more efficient mapping of the P(x,AV) probability distribution than the traditionally employed uniform-grid sampling. This new version of empirical population synthesis is used to investigate the ability to recover the detailed history of star formation and chemical evolution using this spectral base. This is studied as a function of (i) the magnitude of the measurement errors and (ii) the set of observables used in the synthesis. Extensive simulations with test galaxies are used for this purpose. The emphasis is put on the comparison of input parameters and the mean x and AV associated with the P(x,AV) distribution. It is found that only for extremely low errors [signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)>300 at 5870{\AA}] all 12 base proportions can be accurately recovered, though the observables are recovered very precisely for any S/N. Furthermore, the individual x components are biased in the sense that components which carry a large fraction of the light tend to share their contribution preferably among components of same age. Old, metal-poor components can also be confused with younger, metal-rich components because of the age-metallicity degeneracy. These compensation effects are linked to noise-induced linear dependences in the base, which redistribute the likelihood in x-space very effectively. The age distribution, however, can be satisfactorily recovered for realistic S/N (~30). We also find that synthesizing equivalent widths and colours produces better focused results that those obtained synthesizing only equivalent widths, despite the inclusion of the extinction as an extra parameter.},

A shift from the traditional approach of combining data and analysis at the desktop to the use of remote services, pushing the computation to the data, is now underway. In the field of cosmological gravitational microlensing, future synoptic all-sky surveys are expected to bring the number of multiply imaged quasars from the few tens that are currently known to a few thousands. This inflow of observational data, together with computationally demanding theoretical modeling via the production of microlensing magnification maps, requires a new approach. We present our technical solutions to supporting the GPU-Enabled, High Resolution cosmological MicroLensing parameter survey (GERLUMPH). This extensive dataset for cosmological microlensing modeling comprises over 70 000 individual magnification maps and ˜106 related results. We describe our approaches to hosting, organizing, and serving ˜ 30 TB of data and metadata products. We present a set of online analysis tools developed with PHP, JavaScript and WebGL to support access and analysis of GELRUMPH data in a Web browser. We discuss our use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate data production, and we release the core of the GPU-D direct inverse ray-shooting code (Thompson et al., 2010, 2014) used to generate the magnification maps. All of the GERLUMPH data and tools are available online from  http://gerlumph.swin.edu.au. This project made use of gSTAR, the GPU Supercomputer for Theoretical Astrophysical Research.},

	Abstract = {We have used optical Integral Field Spectroscopy in order to map the star formation history of the inner kiloparsec of the post-starburst quasar (PSQ) J0330-0532 and to map its gas and stellar kinematics as well as the gas excitation. PSQs are hypothesized to represent a stage in the evolution of galaxies in which the star formation has been recently quenched due to the feedback of the nuclear activity, as suggested by the presence of the post-starburst population at the nucleus. We have found that the old stellar population (age >= 2.5 Gyr) dominates the flux at 5100 {\AA} in the inner 0.26 kpc, while both the post-starburst (100 Myr <= age <2.5 Gyr) and starburst (age <100 Myr) components dominate the flux in a circumnuclear ring at ≈0.5 kpc from the nucleus. With our spatially resolved study we have not found any post-starburst stellar population in the inner 0.26 kpc. On the other hand, we do see the signature of AGN feedback in this region, which does not reach the circumnuclear ring where the post-starburst population is observed. We thus do not support the quenching scenario for the PSQ J0330-0532. In addition, we have concluded that the strong signature of the post-starburst population in larger aperture spectra (e.g. from Sloan Digital Sky Survey) is partially due to the combination of the young and old age components. Based on the MBH - sigmastar relationship and the stellar kinematics we have estimated a mass for the supermassive black hole of 1.48 $\pm$ 0.66 × 107 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a study of the photometric redshift performance of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), using the early data from a Science Verification period of observations in late 2012 and early 2013 that provided science-quality images for almost 200 sq. deg. at the nominal depth of the survey. We assess the photometric redshift (photo-z) performance using about 15 000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from other surveys. These galaxies are used, in different configurations, as a calibration sample, and photo-z's are obtained and studied using most of the existing photo-z codes. A weighting method in a multidimensional colour-magnitude space is applied to the spectroscopic sample in order to evaluate the photo-z performance with sets that mimic the full DES photometric sample, which is on average significantly deeper than the calibration sample due to the limited depth of spectroscopic surveys. Empirical photo-z methods using, for instance, artificial neural networks or random forests, yield the best performance in the tests, achieving core photo-z resolutions sigma68 ˜ 0.08. Moreover, the results from most of the codes, including template-fitting methods, comfortably meet the DES requirements on photo-z performance, therefore, providing an excellent precedent for future DES data sets.},

This provides a completely independent method from other forms of electronic, optical, mechanical or magnetic feedback or real-time astrometry. Our goal is to reach the subarcminute range which is considerably smaller than the field-of-view of conventional imaging telescope systems. Here we present how this subarcminute accuracy can be achieved with very cheap MEMS sensors and we also detail how our procedures can be extended in order to attain even finer measurements. In addition, our paper discusses how can a complete system design be implemented in order to be a part of a telescope control system.},

	Abstract = {Context. Accurate photometric redshifts for large samples of galaxies are among the main products of modern multiband digital surveys. Over the last decade, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has become a sort of benchmark against which to test the various methods.  Aims: We present an application of a new method to the estimation of photometric redshifts for the galaxies in the SDSS Data Release 9 (SDSS-DR9). Photometric redshifts for more than 143 million galaxies were produced.  Methods: The Multi Layer Perceptron with Quasi Newton Algorithm (MLPQNA) model, provided within the framework of the DAta Mining and Exploration Web Application REsource (DAMEWARE), is an interpolative method derived from machine learning models.  Results: The obtained redshifts have an overall uncertainty of sigma = 0.023 with a very small average bias of ~3 × 10-5, and a fraction of catastrophic outliers (|Deltaz| > 2sigma) of ~5%. This result is slightly better than what was already available in the literature in terms of the smaller fraction of catastrophic outliers as well.  The produced catalogue, composed by 58 tables is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/568/A126},

	Abstract = {After a pedagogical introduction to the main concepts of synthetic photometry, colours and bolometric corrections in the Johnson-Cousins, 2MASS, and HST-ACS/WFC3 photometric systems are generated from MARCS synthetic fluxes for various [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] combinations, and virtually any value of E(B - V) ≲ 0.7. The successes and failures of model fluxes in reproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted. Overall, extant synthetic fluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections, especially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the predictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of hydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free parameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch and lower main-sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the concomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to produce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to interpolate in them. These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to convert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a constant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how such an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors. The MARCS transformations presented in this study promise to provide important constraints on our understanding of the multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (e.g. the colours of lower main-sequence stars are predicted to depend strongly on [alpha/Fe]) and of those located towards/in the Galactic bulge.},

	Abstract = {We present a methodology for the regularization and combination of sparse sampled and irregularly gridded observations from fibre-optic multiobject integral field spectroscopy. The approach minimizes interpolation and retains image resolution on combining subpixel dithered data. We discuss the methodology in the context of the Sydney-AAO multiobject integral field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey underway at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The SAMI instrument uses 13 fibre bundles to perform high-multiplex integral field spectroscopy across a 1$\,^{\circ}$ diameter field of view. The SAMI Galaxy Survey is targeting ˜3000 galaxies drawn from the full range of galaxy environments. We demonstrate the subcritical sampling of the seeing and incomplete fill factor for the integral field bundles results in only a 10 per cent degradation in the final image resolution recovered. We also implement a new methodology for tracking covariance between elements of the resulting data cubes which retains 90 per cent of the covariance information while incurring only a modest increase in the survey data volume.},

	Abstract = {As astronomy becomes increasingly invested in large surveys the ample representation of an individual target becomes a significant challenge. Tabulations of basic properties can convey the message in an absolute sense but not within the context of the sample from which the individual is drawn. We present a novel but simple plot that simultaneously visualises the properties of the sample and the individual. Numbers and characters are kept at an absolute minimum to enable the stacking of such plots without introducing too much verbal information. Once the user becomes accustomed to their appearance, a set of starfish diagrams provides a direct representation of the individual within a sample, or between various samples. The utility and versatility of the plot is demonstrated through its application to astrophysical data (SAMI Galaxy Survey) and sports statistics. We provide a brief description of the concept and the source code, which is simple to adapt to any statistical dataset, be it descriptive of physics, demographics, finance, and more.},

	Abstract = {We use a highly complete subset of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly II (GAMA-II) redshift sample to fully describe the stellar mass dependence of close pairs and mergers between 108 and 1012 M&sun;. Using the analytic form of this fit we investigate the total stellar mass accreting on to more massive galaxies across all mass ratios. Depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, the fraction of mass merging on to more massive companions is 2.0-5.6 per cent. Using the GAMA-II data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close pair fraction between redshift z = 0.05 and 0.2. However, we find a systematically higher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close pairs compared to published results over a similar redshift baseline. Using a compendium of data and the function gammaM = A(1 + z)m to predict the major close pair fraction, we find fitting parameters of A = 0.021 $\pm$ 0.001 and m = 1.53 $\pm$ 0.08, which represents a higher low-redshift normalization and shallower power-law slope than recent literature values. We find that the relative importance of in situ star formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, with star formation dominating the addition of stellar material below M^* and merger accretion events dominating beyond M^*. We find mergers have a measurable impact on the whole extent of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), manifest as a deepening of the `dip' in the GSMF over the next ˜Gyr and an increase in M^* by as much as 0.01-0.05 dex.},

	Abstract = {Powerful telescopes equipped with multi-fibre or integral field spectrographs combined with detailed models of stellar atmospheres and automated fitting techniques allow for the analysis of large number of stars. These datasets contain a wealth of information that require new analysis techniques to bridge the gap between observations and stellar evolution models. To that end, we develop Bonnsai (BONN Stellar Astrophysics Interface), a Bayesian statistical method, that is capable of comparing all available observables simultaneously to stellar models while taking observed uncertainties and prior knowledge such as initial mass functions and distributions of stellar rotational velocities into account. Bonnsai can be used to (1) determine probability distributions of fundamental stellar parameters such as initial masses and stellar ages from complex datasets; (2) predict stellar parameters that were not yet observationally determined; and (3) test stellar models to further advance our understanding of stellar evolution. An important aspect of Bonnsai is that it singles out stars that cannot be reproduced by stellar models through chi2 hypothesis tests and posterior predictive checks. Bonnsai can be used with any set of stellar models and currently supports massive main-sequence single star models of Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud composition. We apply our new method to mock stars to demonstrate its functionality and capabilities. In a first application, we use Bonnsai to test the stellar models of Brott et al. (2011, A&A, 530, A115) by comparing the stellar ages inferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing Milky Way binaries of which the components range in mass between 4.5 and 28 M&sun;. Ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii that are known to better than 3%. We show that the stellar models must include rotation because stellar radii can be increased by several percent via centrifugal forces. We find that the average age difference between the primary and secondary stars of the binaries is 0.9 $\pm$ 2.3 Myr (95% CI), i.e. that the stellar models reproduce the Milky Way binaries well. The predicted effective temperatures are in agreement for observed effective temperatures for stars cooler than 25 000 K. In hotter stars, i.e. stars earlier than B1-2V and more massive than about 10 M&sun;, we find that the observed effective temperatures are on average hotter by 1.1 $\pm$ 0.3 kK (95% CI) and the bolometric luminosities are consequently larger by 0.06 $\pm$ 0.02 dex (95% CI) than predicted by the stellar models.

	Abstract = {Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting is a key instrument in understanding the physical properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass, stellar age, dust content, metallicity, and star formation history. Traditionally, when spectroscopic information is not available, the photometric redshifts of galaxies and the SED fitting parameters are evaluated separately, by means of photo-z codes based on empirical templates and SED fitting algorithms based on theoretical templates libraries. We present our implementation of a fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, SpeedyMC (Acquaviva et al 2011), to fit photometric redshifts and galaxy properties at the same time. This approach has the obvious advantage that the uncertainty in the photometric redshifts is correctly incorporated in the estimation of the probability distribution functions of the SED fitting parameters. We compare the performance of SpeedyMC in estimating redshifts to that of photo-z codes like EAZY (Brammer et al 2008) and evaluate the impact of using the joint redshift+parameters analysis on different sets of multi-wavelength data.},

@article{Andreon.2012a,
	Abstract = {This work measures the evolution of the iron content in galaxy clusters by a rigorous analysis of the data of 130 clusters at 0.1 < z < 1.3. This task is made difficult by a) the low signal-to-noise ratio of abundance measurements and the upper limits; b) possible selection effects; c) boundaries in the parameter space; d) non-Gaussian errors; e) the intrinsic variety of the objects studied; and f) abundance systematics. We introduce a Bayesian model to address all these issues at the same time, thus allowing cross-talk (covariance). On simulated data, the Bayesian fit recovers the input enrichment history, unlike in standard analysis. After accounting for a possible dependence on X-ray temperature, for metal abundance systematics, and for the intrinsic variety of studied objects, we found that the present-day metal content is not reached either at high or at low redshifts, but gradually over time: iron abundance increases by a factor 1.5 in the 7 Gyr sampled by the data. Therefore, feedback in metal abundance does not end at high redshift. Evolution is established with a moderate amount of evidence, 19 to 1 odds against faster or slower metal enrichment histories. We quantify, for the first time, the intrinsic spread in metal abundance, 18 $\pm$ 3%, after correcting for the effect of evolution, X-ray temperature, and metal abundance systematics. Finally, we also present an analytic approximation of the X-ray temperature and metal abundance likelihood functions, which are useful for other regression fitting involving these parameters. The data for the 130 clusters and code used for the stochastic computation are provided with the paper.

@article{Acquaviva.Raichoor.Gawiser.2015a,
	Abstract = {We seek to improve the accuracy of joint galaxy photometric redshift estimation and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. By simulating different sources of uncorrected systematic errors, we demonstrate that if the uncertainties in the photometric redshifts are estimated correctly, so are those on the other SED fitting parameters, such as stellar mass, stellar age, and dust reddening. Furthermore, we find that if the redshift uncertainties are over(under)-estimated, the uncertainties in SED parameters tend to be over(under)-estimated by similar amounts. These results hold even in the presence of severe systematics and provide, for the first time, a mechanism to validate the uncertainties on these parameters via comparison with spectroscopic redshifts. We propose a new technique (annealing) to re-calibrate the joint uncertainties in the photo-z and SED fitting parameters without compromising the performance of the SED fitting + photo-z estimation. This procedure provides a consistent estimation of the multi-dimensional probability distribution function in SED fitting + z parameter space, including all correlations. While the performance of joint SED fitting and photo-z estimation might be hindered by template incompleteness, we demonstrate that the latter is ``flagged'' by a large fraction of outliers in redshift, and that significant improvements can be achieved by using flexible stellar populations synthesis models and more realistic star formation histories. In all cases, we find that the median stellar age is better recovered than the time elapsed from the onset of star formation. Finally, we show that using a photometric redshift code such as EAZY to obtain redshift probability distributions that are then used as priors for SED fitting codes leads to only a modest bias in the SED fitting parameters and is thus a viable alternative to the simultaneous estimation of SED parameters and photometric redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of two multi-chord stellar occultations by the dwarf planet (1) Ceres that were observed from Brazil on 2010 August 17, and from the USA on 2013 October 25. Four positive detections were obtained for the 2010 occultation, and nine for the 2013 occultation. Elliptical models were adjusted to the observed chords to obtain Ceres' size and shape. Two limb fitting solutions were studied for each event. The first one is a nominal solution with an indeterminate polar aspect angle. The second one was constrained by the pole coordinates as given by Drummond et al. Assuming a Maclaurin spheroid, we determine an equatorial diameter of 972 $\pm$ 6 km and an apparent oblateness of 0.08 $\pm$ 0.03 as our best solution. These results are compared to all available size and shape determinations for Ceres made so far, and shall be confirmed by the NASA's Dawn space mission.},

	Abstract = {The results of a three-month continuous monitoring of the turbulence profile and seeing at Cerro Tololo (Chile) in 2002 May-July are presented. Some 28000 low-resolution profiles were measured by a new MASS single-star turbulence monitor, accompanied by seeing data from DIMM. The median seeing was 0.95 arcsec. The first 500 m contribute 60 per cent to the total seeing, and the free-atmosphere median seeing was 0.55 arcsec. The free-atmosphere seeing is almost never better than 0.15 arcsec because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-d period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2-0.3 arcsec was noted. The gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of the ground layer will be typically 1.7 times, and 2-3 times during such calm periods. Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at the tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with the ground wind are studied. The temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their typical duration increasing from 15 min in low layers to 1-2 h in high layers. The large data base of turbulence profiles can be used to test mesoscale modelling of astronomical seeing.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra  effort.

	Abstract = {We show the potential that the T80 telescope of the Javalambre observatory has for the GRB field. Its rapid pointing capabilities as well as its wide field of view makes the T80 an ideal tool for rapid GRB responses. We stress on using the T80 to search for optical counterparts in the the large error boxes provided by FERMI. Once an alert is received we would activate continuous cycles of ugriz-band images with the aim to construct dense lightcurves in the whole optical range. The JPAS survey, developed also at OAJ, opens the possibility of using pre-GRB host galaxy images, either as subtraction templates or to study the hosts in 54 narrow bands. The synergy of the T80 with large aperture telescopes, like VLT or GTC where we run spectroscopic target of opportunity programs, can be really productive.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HdeltaA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

	Abstract = {The Advance Large Homogeneous Area Medium-Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) survey has observed eight different regions of the sky, including sections of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), DEEP2, European Large-Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey (ELAIS), Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North (GOODS-N), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Groth fields using a new photometric system with 20 optical, contiguous ˜300-{\AA} filters plus the JHKs bands. The filter system is designed to optimize the effective photometric redshift depth of the survey, while having enough wavelength resolution for the identification of faint emission lines. The observations, carried out with the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope using the wide-field optical camera Large Area Imager for Calar Alto (LAICA) and the near-infrared (NIR) instrument Omega-2000, represent a total of ˜700 h of on-target science images. Here we present multicolour point-spread function (PSF) corrected photometry and photometric redshifts for ˜438 000 galaxies, detected in synthetic F814W images. The catalogues are complete down to a magnitude I ˜ 24.5 AB and cover an effective area of 2.79 deg2. Photometric zero-points were calibrated using stellar transformation equations and refined internally, using a new technique based on the highly robust photometric redshifts measured for emission-line galaxies. We calculate Bayesian photometric redshifts with the Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ)2.0 code, obtaining a precision of deltaz/(1 + zs) = 1 per cent for I < 22.5 and deltaz/(1 + zs) = 1.4 per cent for 22.5 < I < 24.5. The global n(z) distribution shows a mean redshift <z> = 0.56 for I < 22.5 AB and <z> = 0.86 for I < 24.5 AB. Given its depth and small cosmic variance, ALHAMBRA is a unique data set for galaxy evolution studies.},

	Abstract = {We present the first Public Data Release (PDR-1) of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Survey (VIPERS). It comprises 57 204 spectroscopic measurements together with all additional information necessary for optimal scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the associated photometric measurements and quantification of the photometric and survey completeness. VIPERS is an ESO Large Programme designed to build a spectroscopic sample of ~=100 000 galaxies with iAB < 22.5 and 0.5 < z < 1.2 with high sampling rate (~=45%). The survey spectroscopic targets are selected from the CFHTLS-Wide five-band catalogues in the W1 and W4 fields. The final survey will cover a total area of nearly 24 deg2, for a total comoving volume between z = 0.5 and 1.2 of ~=4 × 107 h-3 Mpc3 and a median galaxy redshift of z ~= 0.8. The release presented in this paper includes data from virtually the entire W4 field and nearly half of the W1 area, thus representing 64% of the final dataset. We provide a detailed description of sample selection, observations and data reduction procedures; we summarise the global properties of the spectroscopic catalogue and explain the associated data products and their use, and provide all the details for accessing the data through the survey database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vipers.inaf.it">http://vipers.inaf.it</ext-link>) where all information can be queried interactively.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Cerro Paranal, Chile, using the Very Large Telescope under programs 182.A-0886 and partly 070.A-9007. Also based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This work is based in part on data products produced at TERAPIX and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.

@article{Schodel.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We present a method for speckle holography that is optimized for crowded fields. Its two key features are an iterative improvement of the instantaneous point spread functions (PSFs) extracted from each speckle frame and the (optional) simultaneous use of multiple reference stars. In this way, high signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy can be achieved on the PSF for each short exposure, which results in sensitive, high-Strehl reconstructed images. We have tested our method with different instruments, on a range of targets, and from the N[10 mum] to the I[0.9 mum] band. In terms of PSF cosmetics, stability and Strehl ratio, holographic imaging can be equal, and even superior, to the capabilities of currently available adaptive optics (AO) systems, particularly at short near-infrared to optical wavelengths. It outperforms lucky imaging because it makes use of the entire PSF and reduces the need for frame selection, thus, leading to higher Strehl and improved sensitivity. Image reconstruction a posteriori, the possibility to use multiple reference stars and the fact that these reference stars can be rather faint means that holographic imaging offers a simple way to image large, dense stellar fields near the diffraction limit of large telescopes, similar to, but much less technologically demanding than, the capabilities of a multiconjugate AO system. The method can be used with a large range of already existing imaging instruments and can also be combined with AO imaging when the corrected PSF is unstable.},

	Abstract = {We report the first analytical expression purely constructed by a machine to determine photometric redshifts (zphot) of galaxies. A simple and reliable functional form is derived using 41 214 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 (SDSS-DR10) spectroscopic sample. The method automatically dropped the u and z bands, relying only on g, r and i for the final solution. Applying this expression to other 1417 181 SDSS-DR10 galaxies, with measured spectroscopic redshifts (zspec), we achieved a mean <(zphot - zspec)/(1 + zspec)> ≲ 0.0086 and a scatter sigma(zphot - zspec)/(1 + zspec) ≲ 0.045 when averaged up to z ≲ 1.0. The method was also applied to the PHAT0 data set, confirming the competitiveness of our results when faced with other methods from the literature. This is the first use of symbolic regression in cosmology, representing a leap forward in astronomy-data-mining connection.},

	Abstract = {Large direct imaging surveys usually use a template-fitting technique to estimate photometric redshifts for galaxies, which are then applied to derive important galaxy properties such as luminosities and stellar masses. These estimates can be noisy and suffer from systematic biases because of the possible mis-selection of templates and the propagation of the photometric redshift uncertainty. We introduce an algorithm, the Direct Empirical Photometric method (DEmP), that can be used to directly estimate these quantities using training sets, bypassing photometric redshift determination. DEmP also applies two techniques to minimize the effects arising from the non-uniform distribution of training set galaxy redshifts from a flux-limited sample. First, for each input galaxy, fitting is performed using a subset of the training set galaxies with photometry and colors closest to those of the input galaxy. Second, the training set is artificially resampled to produce a flat distribution in redshift or other properties, e.g., luminosity. To test the performance of DEmP, we use a four filter-band mock catalog to examine its ability to recover redshift, luminosity, stellar mass, and luminosity and stellar mass functions. We also compare the results to those from two publicly available template-fitting methods, finding that the DEmP algorithm outperforms both. We find that resampling the training set to have a uniform redshift distribution produces the best results not only in photometric redshift, but also in estimating luminosity and stellar mass. The DEmP method is especially powerful in estimating quantities such as near-IR luminosities and stellar mass using only data from a small number of optical bands.},

	Abstract = {Context. Cluster galaxies are the ideal sites to look at when studying the influence of the environment on the various aspects of the evolution of galaxies, such as the changes in their stellar content and morphological transformations. In the framework of wings, the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey, we have obtained optical spectra for ~6000 galaxies selected in fields centred on 48 local (0.04 < z < 0.07) X-ray selected clusters to tackle these issues.  Aims: By classifying the spectra based on given spectral lines, we investigate the frequency of the various spectral types as a function of both the clusters' properties and the galaxies' characteristics. In this way, using the same classification criteria adopted for studies at higher redshift, we can consistently compare the properties of the local cluster population to those of their more distant counterparts.  Methods: We describe a method that we have developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral lines in a robust way, even in spectra with a non optimal signal-to-noise ratio. This way, we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, based on the presence and strength of the [Oii] and Hdelta lines.  Results: After a quality check, we are able to measure 4381 of the ~6000 originally observed spectra in the fields of 48 clusters, of which 2744 are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The spectral classification is then analysed as a function of galaxies' luminosity, stellar mass, morphology, local density, and host cluster's global properties and compared to higher redshift samples (MORPHS and EDisCS). The vast majority of galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being also the most luminous and massive. At a magnitude limit of MV < -18, galaxies in a post-starburst phase represent only ~11% of the cluster population, and this fraction is reduced to ~5% at MV < -19.5, which compares to the 18% at the same magnitude limit for high-z clusters. "Normal" star-forming galaxies (e(c)) are proportionally more common in local clusters.  Conclusions: The relative occurrence of post-starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters at redshifts in the 0 to ~1 range. Furthermore, more important than the global environment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolution in local clusters at least with respect to their stellar populations content.

These isochrones are derived from stellar models computed with the most recent radiative opacities by Iglesias et al. (1992). In addition to this we present another set with chemical composition [Z=0.001, Y=0.23] based on models calculated with the radiative opacities by Huebner et al. (1977). All the stellar models are followed from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) to the central carbon ignition for massive stars or to the beginning of the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch phase (TP-AGB) for low and intermediate mass stars. For each isochrone, we give the current mass, effective temperatures, bolometric and visual magnitudes, (U-B), (B-V), (V-R), (V-I), (V-J), (V-H), and (V-K) colors, and the luminosity function for the case of the Salpeter law. In addition to this, integrated magnitudes and colors at several characteristic points are also presented together with the mass of the remnant star when appropriate. The main characteristic that makes this set of isochrones very valuable is based on their extension in mass and chemical composition, besides the calculation of late stages of evolution, beyond the red giant tip till the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula phase.},

	Abstract = {We study two galaxies samples selected in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and in far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws (power law + 2175 {\AA}bump). The Bayesian method allows one to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero: there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log (Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)2+ 0.3298 (NUV-I)2+ 2.1207 (FUV-NUV) + 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408.},

	Abstract = {We perform a detailed analysis of the resolved colors and stellar populations of a complete sample of 323 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.5 < z < 1.5 and 326 SFGs at 1.5 < z < 2.5 in the ERS and CANDELS-Deep region of GOODS-South. Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 1010 M &sun; and have specific star formation rates (SFRs) above 1/tH . We model the seven-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible in the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to ~20% to the integrated SFR, but only 7% or less to the integrated mass of all massive SFGs at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100-200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

@article{Cole.etal.2000a,
	Abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the LambdaCDM cosmology f12(M1,M2) dM1 [1/&surd;2pi] [(deltac1 - deltac2)/ (sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] x exp [-(deltac1 - deltac2)2/ 2(sigma22)] [dsigma21/dM1] d M1 (Omega0=0.3) (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) dM1 dt1 [1/&surd;(2pi)] [1 / sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] [ddeltac1/dt1] [dsigma21/dM1] dM1 dt1 Lambda0=0.7),-> and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since [dN/dM1] [df12/dt1] [M2/M1] dt1 (M1 < M2). z <~1.5.},

	Abstract = {We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 Msolar h-270, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 Msolar. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the Halpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 Msolar. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

	Abstract = {We introduce versatile spectral analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra. VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is robustness as opposed to high-resolution histories, and the method is designed to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover between two and five stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.},

	Abstract = {Using MOPED, we determine non-parametrically the star formation and metallicity history of over 37 000 high-quality galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early data release. We use the entire spectral range, rather than concentrating on specific features, and we estimate the complete star formation history without prior assumptions concerning its form (by constructing so-called `population boxes'). The main results of this initial study are that the star formation rate in SDSS galaxies has been in decline for ~6 Gyr; a metallicity distribution for star-forming gas, which is peaked ~3 Gyr at approximately solar metallicity, inconsistent with closed-box models, but consistent with infall models. We also determine the infall rate of gas in SDSS and show that it has been significant for the last 3 Gyr. We investigate errors using a Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recovering star formation and metallicity histories for such a large sample becomes intractable without data compression methods, particularly the exploration of the likelihood surface. By exploring the whole likelihood surface, we show that age-metallicity degeneracies are not as severe as using only a few spectral features. We find that 65 per cent of galaxies contain a significant old population (with an age of at least 8 Gyr), including recent starburst galaxies, and that over 97 per cent have some stars older than 2 Gyr. It is the first time that a complete star formation and metallicity history, without restrictive assumptions concerning its form have been derived for such a large data set of integrated stellar populations, and the first time that the past star formation history has been determined from the fossil record of the present-day spectra of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Using the MOPED algorithm, we determine non-parametrically the stellar mass function of 96545 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release One. By using the reconstructed spectrum due to starlight, we can eliminate contamination from either emission lines or active galactic nuclei components. Our results give excellent agreement with previous works, but extend their range by more than two decades in mass to 107.5<~Ms/h-2 Msolar<~ 1012. We present both a standard Schechter fit and a fit modified to include an extra, high-mass contribution, possibly from cluster central dominant galaxies. The Schechter fit parameters are phi*= (7.8 +/- 0.1) × 10-3h3 Mpc-3, M*= (7.64 +/- 0.09) × 1010h-2 Msolar and alpha=-1.159 +/- 0.008. Our sample also yields an estimate for the contribution from baryons in stars to the critical density of Omegab*h= (2.39 +/- 0.08) × 10-3, in good agreement with other indicators. Error bars are statistical and a Salpeter initial mass function is assumed throughout. We find no evolution of the mass function in the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.34, indicating that almost all stars were already formed at z~ 0.34 with little or no star formation activity since then and that the evolution seen in the luminosity function must be largely due to stellar fading.},

	Abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types---spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems---and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

	Abstract = {The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerated Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is a narrow band, very wide field Cosmological Survey to be carried out from the Javalambre Observatory in Spain with a purpose-built, dedicated 2.5m telescope and a 4.7 sq.deg. camera with 1.2Gpix. Starting in late 2015, J-PAS will observe 8500sq.deg. of Northern Sky and measure $0.003(1+z)$ photo-z for $9\times10^7$ LRG and ELG galaxies plus several million QSOs, sampling an effective volume of $\sim 14$ Gpc$^3$ up to $z=1.3$ and becoming the first radial BAO experiment to reach Stage IV. J-PAS will detect $7\times 10^5$ galaxy clusters and groups, setting constrains on Dark Energy which rival those obtained from its BAO measurements. Thanks to the superb characteristics of the site (seeing ~0.7 arcsec), J-PAS is expected to obtain a deep, sub-arcsec image of the Northern sky, which combined with its unique photo-z precision will produce one of the most powerful cosmological lensing surveys before the arrival of Euclid. J-PAS unprecedented spectral time domain information will enable a self-contained SN survey that, without the need for external spectroscopic follow-up, will detect, classify and measure $\sigma_z\sim 0.5\%$ redshifts for $\sim 4000$ SNeIa and $\sim 900$ core-collapse SNe. The key to the J-PAS potential is its innovative approach: a contiguous system of 54 filters with $145\AA$ width, placed $100\AA$ apart over a multi-degree FoV is a powerful "redshift machine", with the survey speed of a 4000 multiplexing low resolution spectrograph, but many times cheaper and much faster to build. The J-PAS camera is equivalent to a 4.7 sq.deg. "IFU" and it will produce a time-resolved, 3D image of the Northern Sky with a very wide range of Astrophysical applications in Galaxy Evolution, the nearby Universe and the study of resolved stellar populations.},

A further advantage of the WHAN diagram is to allow the differentiation between two very distinct classes that overlap in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) region of traditional diagnostic diagrams. These are galaxies hosting a weakly active galactic nucleus (wAGN) and 'retired galaxies' (RGs), i.e. galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their hot low-mass evolved stars.  A useful criterion to distinguish true from fake AGN (i.e. the RGs) is the value of xi, which measures the ratio of the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity with respect to the Halpha luminosity expected from photoionization by stellar populations older than 108 yr. We find that xi follows a markedly bimodal distribution, with a xi≫ 1 population composed by systems undergoing star formation and/or nuclear activity, and a peak at xi˜ 1 corresponding to the prediction of the RG model. We base our classification scheme not on xi but on a more readily available and model-independent quantity which provides an excellent observational proxy for xi: the equivalent width of Halpha. Based on the bimodal distribution of WHalpha, we set the practical division between wAGN and RGs at WHalpha= 3 {\AA}.  Five classes of galaxies are identified within the WHAN diagram:  (i) pure star-forming galaxies: ? and WHalpha > 3 {\AA};  (ii) strong AGN (i.e. Seyferts): ? and WHalpha > 6 {\AA};  (iii) weak AGN: ? and WHalpha between 3 and 6 {\AA};  (iv) RGs (i.e. fake AGN): WHalpha < 3 {\AA};  (v) passive galaxies (actually, lineless galaxies): WHalpha and W[N II] < 0.5 {\AA}.  A comparative analysis of star formation histories and of other physical and observational properties in these different classes of galaxies corroborates our proposed differentiation between RGs and wAGN in the LINER-like family. This analysis also shows similarities between strong and weak AGN on the one hand, and retired and passive galaxies on the other.},

	Abstract = {We present fitted UBVRI-ZY and u'g'r'i'z' magnitudes, spectral types, and distances for 2.4 million stars, derived from synthetic photometry of a library spectrum that best matches the Tycho2 BT VT , NOMAD RN , and 2MASS JHK2/S catalog magnitudes. We present similarly synthesized multifilter magnitudes, types, and distances for 4.8 million stars with 2MASS and SDSS photometry to g < 16 within the Sloan survey region, for Landolt and Sloan primary standards, and for Sloan northern (photometric telescope) and southern secondary standards. The synthetic magnitude zero points for BT VT , UBVRI , ZV YV , JHK2/S , JHKMKO , Stromgren uvby, Sloan u'g'r'i'z', and ugirz are calibrated on 20 CALSPEC spectrophotometric standards. The UBVRI and ugriz zero points have dispersions of 1-3%, for standards covering a range of color from - 0.3 < V - I < 4.6 ; those for other filters are in the range of 2-5%. The spectrally matched fits to Tycho2 stars provide estimated 1sigma errors per star of ˜ 0.2 , 0.15, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.08 mag, respectively, in either UBVRI or u'g'r'i'z'; those for at least 70% of the SDSS survey region to g < 16 have estimated 1sigma errors per star of ˜ 0.2 , 0.06, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.05 in u'g'r'i'z' or UBVRI. The density of Tycho2 stars, averaging about 60 stars per square degree, provides sufficient stars to enable automatic flux calibrations for most digital images with fields of view of 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ or more. Using several such standards per field, automatic flux calibration can be achieved to a few percent in any filter, at any air mass, in most workable observing conditions, to facilitate intercomparison of data from different sites, telescopes, and instruments.},

@article{Strauss.etal.2002a,
	Abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r<=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses mu50<=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (~0.1%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

@article{Bessell.2005a,
	Abstract = {Standard star photometry dominated the latter half of the twentieth century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum efficiency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modified and refined, and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems, and the precision and accuracy of much broad- and intermediate-band photometry suffered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based, dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined, and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere fluxes are now very realistic, and synthetic photometry offers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic analysis of 492 450 galaxy spectra from the first two years of observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III/Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. This data set has been released in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS spectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra, despite being low, is sufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for individual objects. We show that the typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is ˜240 km s-1. The typical error in the velocity dispersion measurement is 14 per cent, and 93 per cent of BOSS galaxies have velocity dispersions with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent between redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting massive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this redshift interval. We show that emission lines can be measured on BOSS spectra. However, the majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission lines, as is to be expected because of the target selection design towards massive galaxies. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams using the emission lines [O II], Hbeta, [O III], Halpha and [N II] (detected in about 4 per cent of the galaxies) to separate star-forming objects and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We show that the emission line properties are strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between observed frame colours and emission line properties. Within in the low-z sample (LOWZ) around 0.15 < z < 0.3, half of the emission line galaxies have low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like emission line ratios, followed by Seyfert-AGN-dominated spectra, and only a small fraction of a few per cent are purely star-forming galaxies. AGN and LINER-like objects, instead, are less prevalent in the high-z sample (CMASS) around 0.4 < z < 0.7, where more than half of the emission line objects are star forming. This is a pure selection effect caused by the non-detection of weak Hbeta emission lines in the BOSS spectra. Finally, we show that star-forming, AGN and emission line free galaxies are well separated in the g - r versus r - i target selection diagram.},

	Abstract = {A method of abundance determination based on reddening-independent properties of low-resolution spectral scans is described and applied to 177 red giants in 19 globular clusters, most of which are at galactocentric distances in excess of 8 kpc. The general properties of the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been completed.},

@article{Brinchmann.etal.2004a,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

@article{Brinchmann.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We present a method to estimate the total gas column density, dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios of distant galaxies from rest-frame optical spectra. The technique exploits the sensitivity of certain optical lines to changes in depletion of metals on to dust grains and uses photoionization models to constrain these physical ratios along with the metallicity and dust column density. We compare our gas column density estimates with H I and CO gas mass estimates in nearby galaxies to show that we recover their total gas mass surface density to within a factor of 2 up to a total surface gas mass density of ˜75 M&sun; pc-2. Our technique is independent of the conversion factor of CO to H2 and we show that a metallicity-dependent XCO is required to achieve good agreement between our measurements and that provided by CO and H I. However, we also show that our method cannot be reliably aperture corrected to total integrated gas mass. We calculate dust-to-gas ratios for all star-forming galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and show that the resulting dependence on metallicity agrees well with the trend inferred from modelling of the dust emission of nearby galaxies using far-IR data. We also present estimates of the variation of the dust-to-metal ratio with metallicity and show that this is poorly constrained at metallicities below 50 per cent solar. We conclude with a study of the inventory of gas in the central regions, defined both in terms of a fixed physical radius and as a fixed fraction of the half-light radius, of ˜70 000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that their central gas content and gas depletion time are not accurately predicted by a single parameter, but in agreement with recent studies we find that a combination of the stellar mass and some measure of central concentration provides a good predictor of gas content in galaxies. We also identify a population of galaxies with low surface densities of stars and very long gas depletion times.},

	Abstract = {We describe a system that builds a high dynamic-range and wide-angle image of the night sky by combining a large set of input images. The method makes use of pixel-rank information in the individual input images to improve a "consensus" pixel rank in the combined image. Because it only makes use of ranks and the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of images, the method is useful for large sets of uncalibrated images that might have undergone unknown non-linear tone mapping transformations for visualization or aesthetic reasons. We apply the method to images of the night sky (of unknown provenance) discovered on the Web. The method permits discovery of astronomical objects or features that are not visible in any of the input images taken individually. More importantly, however, it permits scientific exploitation of a huge source of astronomical images that would not be available to astronomical research without our automatic system.},

	Abstract = {We study the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of two star-forming galaxies at z = 0.1 from the larger DYnamics of Newly Assembled Massive Objects (DYNAMO) sample. These galaxies, which have been characterized by high levels of star formation and large ionized gas velocity dispersions, are considered possible analogs to high-redshift clumpy disks. They were observed using the GMOS instrument in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode at the Gemini Observatory with high spectral resolution (R=5400, equivalent to 24 km/s at the observed wavelengths) and 6 hour exposure times in order to measure the resolved stellar kinematics via absorption lines. We also obtain higher-quality emission line kinematics than previous observations. The spatial resolution (1.2 kpc) is sufficient to show that the ionized gas in these galaxies (as traced by H-beta emission) is morphologically irregular, forming multiple giant clumps while stellar continuum light is smooth and well described by an exponential profile. Clumpy gas morphologies observed in IFS data are confirmed by complementary narrow band H-alpha imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. Morphological differences between the stars and ionized gas are not reflected dynamically as stellar kinematics are found the be closely coupled to the kinematics of the ionized gas: both components are smoothly rotating with large velocity dispersions (~40 km/s) suggesting that the high gas dispersions are not primarily driven by star-formation feedback. In addition, the stellar population ages of these galaxies are estimated to be quite young (60-500 Myr). The large velocity dispersions measured for these young stars suggest that we are seeing the formation of thick disks and/or stellar bulges in support of recent models which produce these from clumpy galaxies at high redshift.},

	Abstract = {At any given epoch, the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) carries imprints of integrated star formation activities in the universe till that epoch. On the other hand, in order to estimate the EBL, when direct observations are not possible, one requires accurate estimation of star formation rate density (SFRD) and dust attenuation ($A_\nu$) in galaxies. Here, we present a 'progressive fitting method' that determines global average SFRD($z$) and $A_\nu$($z$) for any given extinction curve by using available multi-wavelength multi-epoch luminosity function measurements. Using the available observations, we determine the best fitted combinations of SFRD($z$) and $A_\nu$($z$), in an easily usable fitting forms, up to $z\sim8$ for five well known extinction curves. We find, irrespective of the extinction curve used, the $z$ at which the SFRD($z$) peaks is higher than the $z$ above which $A_\nu$($z$) begins to decline. For each case, we compute the EBL from ultra-violet to the far-infrared and optical depth ($\tau_\gamma$) encountered by the high energy $\gamma$-rays due to pair production upon collisions with these EBL photons. We compare these with measurements of the local EBL, $\gamma$-ray horizon and $\tau_\gamma$ measurements using Fermi-LAT. All these and comparison of independent SFRD($z$) and $A_\nu$($z$) measurements in the literature with our predictions favor the extinction curve similar to that of Large Magellanic Cloud Supershell.},

	Abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method to classify the broad band optical-NIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies using three shape parameters (super-colours) based on a Principal Component Analysis of model SEDs. As well as providing a compact representation of the wide variety of SED shapes, the method allows for easy visualisation of information loss and biases caused by the incomplete sampling of the rest-frame SED as a function of redshift. We apply the method to galaxies in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey with 0.9<z<1.2, and confirm our classifications by stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a fraction of objects in each class. As well as cleanly separating a tight red-sequence from star-forming galaxies, three unusual populations are identifiable by their unique colours: very dusty star-forming galaxies with high metallicity and old mean stellar age; post-starburst galaxies which have formed greater than around 10% of their mass in a recent unsustained starburst event; and metal-poor quiescent dwarf galaxies. We find that quiescent galaxies account for 45% of galaxies with log(M*/Msol)>11, declining steadily to 13% at log(M*/Msol)=10. The properties and mass-function of the post-starburst galaxies are consistent with a scenario in which gas-rich mergers contribute to the growth of the low and intermediate mass range of the red sequence.},

@article{Madau.etal.1996a,
	Abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z>~2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3<~z<~3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2<~z<~4.5. While none of the ~60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0<~z<~1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6<~z<~3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at <z>=2.75 of ~=3.6x10^-4 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3 (for q_0=0.5 and H_0=50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z~=1. At <z>=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is ~=3 times lower than the <z>=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

@article{Kass.1995,
	Abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

	Abstract = {We seek to derive star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses (M_star) in distant galaxies and to quantify the main uncertainties affecting their measurement. We explore the impact of the assumptions made in their derivation with standard calibrations or through a fitting process, as well as the impact of the available data, focusing on the role of IR emission originating from dust. We build a sample of galaxies with z>1, all observed from the UV to the IR (rest frame). The data are fitted with the code CIGALE, which is also used to build and analyse a catalogue of mock galaxies. Models with different SFHs are introduced. We define different set of data, with or without a good sampling of the UV range, NIR, and thermal IR data. The impact of these different cases on the determination of M_star and SFR are analysed. Exponentially decreasing models with a redshift formation of the stellar population z ~8 cannot fit the data correctly. The other models fit the data correctly at the price of unrealistically young ages when the age of the single stellar population is taken to be a free parameter. The best fits are obtained with two stellar populations. As long as one measurement of the dust emission continuum is available, SFR are robustly estimated whatever the chosen model is, including standard recipes. M_star measurement is more subject to uncertainty, depending on the chosen model and the presence of NIR data, with an impact on the SFR-M_star scatter plot. Conversely, when thermal IR data from dust emission are missing, the uncertainty on SFR measurements largely exceeds that of stellar mass. Among all physical properties investigated here, the stellar ages are found to be the most difficult to constrain and this uncertainty acts as a second parameter in SFR measurements and as the most important parameter for M_star measurements.},

@article{Pelat.1998a,
	Abstract = {In order to derive the stellar population of a galaxy or a star cluster, it is a common practice to fit its spectrum by a combination of spectra extracted from a data base (e.g. a library of stellar spectra). If the data to be fitted are equivalent widths, the combination is a non-linear one and the problem of finding the `best' combination of stars that fits the data becomes complex. It is probably because of this complexity that the mathematical aspects of the problem did not receive a satisfying treatment; the question of the uniqueness of the solution, for example, was left in uncertainty. In this paper we complete the solution of the problem by considering the underdetermined case where there are fewer equivalent widths to fit than stars in the data base (the overdetermined case was treated previously). The underdetermined case is interesting to consider because it leaves space for the addition of supplementary astrophysical constraints. In fact, it is shown in this paper that when a solution exists it is generally not unique. There are infinitely many solutions, all of them contained within a convex polyhedron in the solutions vector space. The vertices of this polyhedron are extremal solutions of the stellar population synthesis. If no exact solution exists, an approximate solution can be found using the method described for the overdetermined case. Also provided is an algorithm able to solve the problem numerically; in particular all the vertices of the polyhedron are found.},

@article{Pelat.1997a,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new solution of the stellar population synthesis problem using as primary information the equivalent width of the absorption lines observed in the spectra of, say, a galaxy. It is shown that this problem leads to a formulation akin to the maximum entropy method so successfully applied in image analysis and elsewhere. Emphasis is placed on the fact that it is a certain type of inverse problem for which many local solutions do exist. Among these local solutions there generally exists a global solution which is difficult to obtain in practice. A new method to search for this solution is proposed. First we solve a problem that is slightly different from the original one but which possesses a unique solution. Then we return to the original problem using that solution as a starting point of a local exploration. Because the change between the two formulations gets smaller as the errors in the data get smaller, we have great confidence that the solution we find in this way is an efficient one. As this solution may not be physical, we argue that either (1) the errors in the observations are too big for any method to work properly or (2) it is the signature of an inadequate stellar base. We then explore all boundaries by removing one or more stars from the data base and retain only those truncated data bases for which the solution is physical. The final solution (called the GPG solution) is that solution which minimizes a certain distance criterion. We have tested our method against noise in the data by Monte Carlo simulations and found it to be generally unbiased and to have a small dispersion around the true value for signal-to-noise ratio as low as 10. This property holds true at very low signal-to-noise ratio for stellar contributions greater than approximately 10 per cent. An example of the new method for the study of the active galaxy NGC 5643 is given.},

The photometric description of the system is done by presenting the full response curve as a product of the filters, CCD, and atmospheric transmission curves, and using some first- and second-order moments of this response function. We also introduce the set of standard stars that defines the system, formed by 31 classic spectrophotometric standard stars which have been used in the calibration of other known photometric systems, and 288 stars, flux calibrated homogeneously, from the Next Generation Spectral Library (NGSL). Based on the NGSL, we determine the transformation equations between Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz photometry and the ALHAMBRA photometric system, in order to establish some relations between both systems. Finally, we develop and discuss a strategy to calculate the photometric zero points of the different pointings in the ALHAMBRA project.},

@article{Madau.1995a,
	Abstract = {We assess the effects of the stochastic attenuation produced by intervening QSO absorption systems on the broadband colors of galaxies at cosmological distances. We compute the H I opacity of a clumpy universe as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines, such as Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, Lyman gamma, and higher order members, and Lyman-continuum absorption. Both the numerous, optically thin Lyman-alpha forest clouds and the rarer, optically thick Lyman limit systems are found to contribute to the obscuration of background sources. We study the mean properties of primeval galaxies at high redshift in four broad optical passbands, Un, B, G, and R. Even if young galaxies radiated a significant amount of ionizing photons, the attenuation due to the accumulated photoelectric opacity along the path is so severe that sources beyond z approximately 3 will drop out of the Un image together. We also show that the observed B-R color of distant galaxies can be much redder than expected from a stellar population. At z approximately 3.5, the blanketing by discrete absorption lines in the Lyman series is so effective that background galaxies appear, on average, 1 mag fainter in B. By z approximately 4, the observed B magnitude increment due to intergalactic absorption exceeds 2 mag. By modeling the intrinsic UV spectral energy distribution of star-forming galaxies with a stellar population synthesis code, we show that the (B-R)AB approximately 0 criterion for identifying 'flat-spectrum,' metal-producing galaxies is biased against objects at z greater than 3. The continuum blanketing from the Lyman series produces a characteristic staircase profile in the transmitted power. We suggest that this cosmic Lyman decrement might be used as a tool to identify high-z galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Several works have now shown that nebular emission can have a significant impact on broad-band photometry of high-redshift galaxies ($z > 3$), and how this can affect parameter estimation from SED fitting. So far relatively small spectroscopic samples have been used to measure this effect. Here we focus on a large spectroscopic sample (N$\sim 2300$) at $z\sim2$, with measured H\alpha\ fluxes for $\sim100$ galaxies. Under appropriate assumptions, our SED fitting code is able to reproduce observed H\alpha\ fluxes, and we infer that $\sim20$% of our sample have parameters significantly affected when nebular emission is taken into account. We also determine how nebular emission can affect selection and parameter estimation of evolved galaxies (Balmer Break galaxies) at high-redshift ($z\sim4$).},

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss an application of machine learning based methods to the identification of candidate AGN from optical survey data and to the automatic classification of AGNs in broad classes. We applied four different machine learning algorithms, namely the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), trained respectively with the Conjugate Gradient, Scaled Conjugate Gradient and Quasi Newton learning rules, and the Support Vector Machines (SVM), to tackle the problem of the classification of emission line galaxies in different classes, mainly AGNs vs non-AGNs, obtained using optical photometry in place of the diagnostics based on line intensity ratios which are classically used in the literature. Using the same photometric features we discuss also the behavior of the classifiers on finer AGN classification tasks, namely Seyfert I vs Seyfert II and Seyfert vs LINER. Furthermore we describe the algorithms employed, the samples of spectroscopically classified galaxies used to train the algorithms, the procedure followed to select the photometric parameters and the performances of our methods in terms of multiple statistical indicators. The results of the experiments show that the application of self adaptive data mining algorithms trained on spectroscopic data sets and applied to carefully chosen photometric parameters represents a viable alternative to the classical methods that employ time-consuming spectroscopic observations.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	Abstract = {Broadband measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measure different regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {We present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains >~1 mum in diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties for radii a>~50 {\AA}. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties. Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum. The model is compared with the observed emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model has 60×10-6 of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~6 {\AA} (NC~100 carbon atoms) to account for the PAH emission features and with 15×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~50 {\AA} to account for the 60 mum flux. The total infrared emission is in excellent agreement with COBE/DIRBE observations at high Galactic latitudes, just as the albedo for our grain model is in accord with observations of the diffuse Galactic light. The aromatic absorption features at 3.3 and 6.2 mum predicted by our dust model are consistent with observations. We calculate infrared emission spectra for our dust model heated by a range of starlight intensities, from 0.3 to 104 times the local interstellar radiation field, and we tabulate the intensities integrated over the SIRTF/IRAC and MIPS bands. We also provide dust opacities tabulated from the extreme-ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {We present a technique to adaptively bin sparse data using weighted Voronoi tessellations (WVTs). WVT binning is a generalization of the Voronoi binning algorithm by Cappellari & Copin, developed for integral field spectroscopy. WVT binning is applicable to many types of data and creates unbiased binning structures with compact bins that do not lead the eye. We apply the algorithm to simulated data, as well as several X-ray data sets, to create adaptively binned intensity images, hardness ratio maps and temperature maps with constant signal-to-noise ratio per bin. We also illustrate the separation of diffuse gas emission from contributions of unresolved point sources in elliptical galaxies. We compare the performance of WVT binning with other adaptive binning and adaptive smoothing techniques. We find that the csmooth tool in CIAO versions 1.1-3.1 creates serious artefacts and advise against its use to interpret diffuse X-ray emission.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function from z=1.3 to z=0.5 using the first 53,608 redshifts of the ongoing VIMOS Public Extragalactic Survey (VIPERS). We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function at several epochs discussing in detail the amount of cosmic variance affecting our estimate. We find that Poisson noise and cosmic variance of the galaxy mass function in the VIPERS survey are comparable with the statistical uncertainties of large surveys in the local universe. VIPERS data allow us to determine with unprecedented accuracy the high-mass tail of the galaxy stellar mass function, which includes a significant number of galaxies that are usually too rare to detect with any of the past spectroscopic surveys. At the epochs sampled by VIPERS, massive galaxies had already assembled most of their stellar mass. We apply a photometric classification in the (U-V) rest-frame colour to compute the mass function of blue and red galaxies, finding evidence for the evolution of their contribution to the total number density budget: the transition mass above which red galaxies dominate is found to be about 10^10.4 M_sun at z=0.55 and evolves proportionally to (1+z)^3. We are able to trace separately the evolution of the number density of blue and red galaxies with masses above 10^11.4 M_sun, in a mass range barely studied in previous work. We find that for such large masses, red galaxies show a milder evolution with redshift, when compared to objects at lower masses. At the same time, we detect a population of similarly massive blue galaxies, which are no longer detectable below z=0.7. These results show the improved statistical power of VIPERS data, and give initial promising indications of mass-dependent quenching of galaxies at z~1. [Abridged]},

@article{Wilkins.etal.2013b,
	Abstract = {By combining optical and near-IR observations from the Hubble Space Telescope with NIR photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope it is possible to measure the rest-frame UV-optical colours of galaxies at z=4-8. The UV-optical spectral energy distribution of star formation dominated galaxies is the result of several different factors. These include the joint distribution of stellar masses, ages, and metallicities, and the subsequent reprocessing by dust and gas in the ISM. Using a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation we investigate the predicted spectral energy distributions of galaxies at high-redshift with a particular emphasis on assessing the potential contribution of nebular emission. We find that the average pure stellar UV-optical colour correlates with both luminosity and redshift such that galaxies at lower-redshift and higher-luminosity are typically redder. Assuming the escape fraction of ionising photons is close to zero, the effect of nebular emission is to redden the UV-optical 1500-V_w colour by, on average, 0.4 mag at z=8 declining to 0.25 mag at z=4. Young and low-metallicity stellar populations, which typically have bluer pure stellar UV-optical colours, produce larger ionising luminosities and are thus more strongly affected by the reddening effects of nebular emission. This causes the distribution of 1500-V_w colours to narrow and the trends with luminosity and redshift to weaken. The strong effect of nebular emission leaves observed-frame colours critically sensitive to the source redshift. For example, increasing the redshift by 0.1 can result in observed frame colours changing by up to ~0.6. These predictions reinforce the need to include nebular emission when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies at high-redshift and also highlight the difficultly in interpreting the observed colours of individual galaxies without precise redshifts.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically derived stellar mass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z < 0.65; median z= 0.2) galaxies in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic redshift survey. These masses, as well as the full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public as part of GAMA data release 2. Although the GAMA database does include near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based on optical data alone. We use generic properties of stellar population synthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle a very good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, M*/Li. Further, we use the observed relation between restframe (g-i) and M*/Li for real GAMA galaxies to argue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves, (g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate M*/Li to an accuracy of ≲0.1 dex (1sigma). This 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-M*/Li relation offers a simple and transparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimal data, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their results to z≲0.4 measurements from GAMA.},

	Abstract = {The posterior probability distribution for a set of model parameters encodes all that the data have to tell us in the context of a given model; it is the fundamental quantity for Bayesian parameter estimation. In order to infer the posterior probability distribution we have to decide how to explore parameter space. Here we compare three prescriptions for how parameter space is navigated, discussing their relative merits. We consider Metropolis-Hasting sampling, Nested sampling and affine-invariant ensemble MCMC sampling. We focus on their performance on toy-model Gaussian likelihoods and on a real-world cosmological data set. We outline the sampling algorithms themselves and elaborate on performance diagnostics such as convergence time, scope for parallelisation, dimensional scaling, requisite tunings and suitability for non-Gaussian distributions. We find that Nested sampling delivers high-fidelity estimates for posterior statistics at low computational cost, and should be adopted in favour of Metropolis-Hastings in many cases. Affine-invariant MCMC is competitive when compute clusters can be utilised for massive parallelisation. Affine-invariant MCMC and existing extensions to Nested sampling naturally probe multi-modal and curving distributions.},

	Abstract = {We compare estimates of stellar mass, M *, and dynamical mass, M d, for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Under the assumption of dynamical homology (i.e.,\tilde{M}_d˜ sigma_0^2 R_e, where sigma0 is the central velocity dispersion and R e is the effective radius), we find a tight but strongly nonlinear relation between the two mass estimates: the best-fit relation is M_* ∝ \tilde{M}_d^{0.73}, with an observed scatter of 0.15 dex. We also find that, at fixed M *, the ratio M_*/\tilde{M}_d depends strongly on galaxy structure, as parameterized by the S{\'e}rsic index, n. The size of the differential effect is on the order of 0.6 dex across 2 < n < 10. The apparent n-dependence of M_*/\tilde{M}_d is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to expectations from simple, spherical and isotropic dynamical models, indicating that assuming homology gives the wrong dynamical mass. To explore this possibility, we have also derived dynamical mass estimates that explicitly account for differences in galaxies' structures. Using this "structure-corrected" dynamical mass estimator, M d,n , the best-fit relation is M * vprop M 0.92$\pm$0.01($\pm$0.08) d,n  with an observed scatter of 0.13 dex. While the data are thus consistent with a linear relation, they do prefer a slightly shallower slope. Further, we see only a small residual trend in M */M d,n  with n. We find no statistically significant systematic trends in M */M d,n  as a function of observed quantities (e.g., apparent magnitude, redshift), or as a function of tracers of stellar populations (e.g., Halpha equivalent width, mean stellar age), nor do we find significantly different behavior for different kinds of galaxies (i.e.,central versus satellite galaxies, emission versus non-emission galaxies). At 99% confidence, the net differential bias in M */M d,n  across a wide range of stellar populations and star formation activities is lsim0.12 dex (≈40%). The very good agreement between stellar mass and structure-corrected dynamical mass strongly suggests, but does not unambiguously prove, that (1) galaxy non-homology has a major impact on dynamical mass estimates, and (2) there are no strong systematic biases in the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from broadband optical spectral energy distributions. Further, accepting the validity of both our stellar and dynamical mass estimates, these results suggest that the central dark-to-luminous mass ratio has a relatively weak mass dependence, but a very small scatter at fixed mass.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been in operation since 2000 April. This paper presents the tenth public data release (DR10) from its current incarnation, SDSS-III. This data release includes the first spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R~22,500 300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10 includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are also included.DR10 also roughly doubles the number of BOSS spectra over those included in the ninth data release. DR10 includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327 stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.},

	Abstract = {Using deep narrow-band imaging and optical spectroscopy from Keck and MMT, we identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies at z=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission line, [O III]4363, is detected at >3\sigma. These detections allow us to determine the gas-phase metal abundances using the "direct" method. After correcting for dust attenuation using Balmer decrements, we find that 10 of these low-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(O/H) <= 7.65 dex or one-tenth solar. Considering measurement uncertainties, we argue that 8 and 4 of them are extremely metal-poor at the 85% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. Our three most metal-deficient galaxies have 12+log(O/H)=7.05^{+0.43}_{-0.12}, 7.09^{+0.53}_{-0.25}, and 7.12^{+0.33}_{-0.24} dex (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowest metallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. We also find that our galaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specific star formation rate (SFR) of (100 Myr)^{-1}, and that they have high central SFR surface densities (average of 0.5 Msun/yr/kpc^2). In addition, more than two-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within a projected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forming galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. We also examine how the gas-phase metallicities compare with the stellar mass and the SFR of the galaxies, and find that while roughly half of our galaxies lie along the M-Z-(SFR) relation, the other half have metallicities that are 0.1-1 dex lower than predicted. Our analysis suggests that this discrepancy is real at the 95% confidence. This indicates that the local M-Z-(SFR) relation may not hold for all low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) at z=0.4-0.8. The high ionization parameter and high electron density seen in our galaxies suggest that they are lower redshift analogs to typical z > 1 galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

	Abstract = {The morphological dependence of the luminosity function is studied, using a sample containing approximately 1500 bright galaxies classified into Hubble types by visual inspection, for a homogeneous sample obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey northern equatorial stripes. Early-type galaxies are shown to have a characteristic magnitude 0.45 mag brighter than that of spiral galaxies in the r* band, consistent with the ``universal characteristic luminosity'' in the B band. The shape of the luminosity function differs rather little among different morphological types: we do not see any symptoms of the sharp decline in the faint end of the luminosity function for early-type galaxies at least 2 mag fainter than the characteristic magnitude, although the faint-end behavior shows a slight decline (alpha<~-1) compared with the total sample. We also show that the rather flat faint-end slope for early-type galaxies is not due to an increasing mixture of dwarf galaxies, which have softer cores. This means that there are numerous faint early-type galaxies with highly concentrated cores.},

@article{Marino.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {The use of IFS is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxes of an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and at high redshift. The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used empirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using new direct abundance measurements. We pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of these calibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and the presence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the analysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based HII regions to date. This new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 HII regions extracted from the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey. Besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas abundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrations with a total of 3423 additional CALIFA HII complexes with abundances derived using the ONS calibration by Pilyugin et al. (2010). The combined analysis of Te-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration to date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all statistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. In particular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance dependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of Pettini and Pagel (2004), Nagao et al. (2006) and P\'erez-Montero and Contini (2009). The O3N2 and N2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygen abundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with random errors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on a large amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex (random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the direct estimations),respectively.},

	Abstract = {We present accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z) in the 2-deg2 COSMOS field. The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A chi2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([O II], Hbeta, Halpha, and Lyalpha) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., Deltaz = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of sigma_{Delta z/(1+z_s)}=0.007 at i + AB < 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i + AB < 24 and z < 1.25, the accuracy is sigma_{Delta z/(1+z_s)}=0.012. The deep NIR and Infrared Array Camera coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z ~ 2, albeit with a lower accuracy (sigma_{Delta z/(1+z_s)}=0.06 at i + AB ~ 24). The redshift distribution of large magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to range from z m = 0.66 at 22 < i + AB < 22.5 to z m = 1.06 at 24.5 < i + AB < 25. At i + AB < 26.0, the multiwavelength COSMOS catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. The COSMOS-30 photo-z enables the full exploitation of this survey for studies of galaxy and large-scale structure evolution at high redshift.},

	Abstract = {The baryonic mass-to-light ratio used to perform the photometry-to-mass conversion has a tremendous influence on the measurement of the baryonic content and distribution, as well as on the determination of the dark halo parameters. Since numerous clues hint at an inside-out formation process for galaxies, a radius-dependant mass-to-light ratio is needed to physically represent the radially varying stellar population. In this article, we use chemo-spectrophotometric galactic evolution (CSPE) models to determine the mass-to-light ratio for a wide range of masses and sizes in the scenario of an inside-out formation process by gas accretion. We apply our method on a SINGS subsample of ten spiral and dwarf galaxies for stellar bands covering from the UV to the MIR. The CSPE models prove to be a good tool to weight the different photometric bands in order to obtain consistent stellar discs' masses regardless of the spectral band used. On the other hand, we show that colour index vs. the mass-to-light ratio relation is an imperfect tool to assign masses to young stellar populations because of the degeneracy affecting mass-to-light ratio in all bands at low colour index. Resulting discs from our analysis are compatible with the maximum disc hypothesis provided that adequate bulge/disc decomposition is performed and correction for the presence of a bar is not neglected since it disturbs the internal disc kinematics.

	Abstract = {We use empirical star formation histories (SFHs), measured from Hubble-Space-Telescope-based resolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesis codes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 50 nearby dwarf galaxies (6.5 < log M */M ☉ < 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). In the presence of realistic SFHs, we compare the modeled and observed SEDs from the ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared and assess the reliability of widely used UV-based star formation rate (SFR) indicators. In the FUV through i bands, we find that the observed and modeled SEDs are in excellent agreement. In the Spitzer 3.6 mum and 4.5 mum bands, we find that modeled SEDs systematically overpredict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, depending on treatment of the TP-AGB stars in the synthesis models. We assess the reliability of UV luminosity as a SFR indicator, in light of independently constrained SFHs. We find that fluctuations in the SFHs alone can cause factor of ~2 variations in the UV luminosities relative to the assumption of a constant SFH over the past 100 Myr. These variations are not strongly correlated with UV-optical colors, implying that correcting UV-based SFRs for the effects of realistic SFHs is difficult using only the broadband SED. Additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars older than 100 Myr can contribute from <5%-100% of the present day UV luminosity, highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formation timescale associated with UV emission. We do find a relationship between UV emission timescale and broadband UV-optical color, though it is different than predictions based on exponentially declining SFH models. Our findings have significant implications for the comparison of UV-based SFRs across low-metallicity populations with diverse SFHs.},

	Abstract = {We derive and parameterize the Galactic mass function (MF) below 1 Msolar characteristic of both single objects and binary systems. We resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the MFs derived from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and from the nearby luminosity functions, respectively. We show that this discrepancy stemmed from two cumulative effects, namely, (1) incorrect color-magnitude-determined distances, due to a substantial fraction of M dwarfs in the HST sample belonging to the metal-depleted thick-disk population, as corrected recently by Zheng et al., and (2) unresolved binaries. We show that both the nearby and HST MF for unresolved systems are consistent with a fraction ~50% of M dwarf binaries, with the mass of both the primaries and the companions originating from the same underlying single MF. This implies that ~30% of M dwarfs should have an M dwarf companion and ~20% should have a brown dwarf companion, in agreement with recent determinations. The present calculations show that the so-called ``brown dwarf desert'' should be reinterpreted as a lack of high mass ratio (m2/m1<~0.1) systems and does not preclude a substantial fraction of brown dwarfs as companions of M dwarfs or for other brown dwarfs.},

@article{Bernardi.etal.2010a,
	Abstract = {We provide fits to the distribution of galaxy luminosity, size, velocity dispersion and stellar mass as a function of concentration index Cr and morphological type in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). (Our size estimate, a simple analogue of the SDSS cmodel magnitude, is new: it is computed using a combination of seeing-corrected quantities in the SDSS data base, and is in substantially better agreement with results from more detailed bulge/disc decompositions.) We also quantify how estimates of the fraction of `early'- or `late'-type galaxies depend on whether the samples were cut in colour, concentration or light profile shape, and compare with similar estimates based on morphology. Our fits show that ellipticals account for about 20 per cent of the r-band luminosity density, , and 25 per cent of the stellar mass density, rho* including S0s and Sas increases these numbers to 33 per cent and 40 per cent, and 50 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively. The values of and rho*, and the mean sizes, of E, E+S0 and E+S0+Sa samples are within 10 per cent of those in the Hyde & Bernardi, Cr >= 2.86 and Cr >= 2.6 samples, respectively. Summed over all galaxy types, we find rho* ~ 3 × 108MsolarMpc-3 at z ~ 0. This is in good agreement with expectations based on integrating the star formation history. However, compared to most previous work, we find an excess of objects at large masses, up to a factor of ~10 at M* ~ 5 × 1011Msolar. The stellar mass density further increases at large masses if we assume different initial mass functions for elliptical and spiral galaxies, as suggested by some recent chemical evolution models, and results in a better agreement with the dynamical mass function.  We also show that the trend for ellipticity to decrease with luminosity is primarily because the E/S0 ratio increases at large L. However, the most massive galaxies, M* >= 5 × 1011Msolar, are less concentrated and not as round as expected if one extrapolates from lower L, and they are not well fit by pure deVaucouleur laws. This suggests formation histories with recent radial mergers. Finally, we show that the age-size relation is flat for ellipticals of fixed dynamical mass, but, at fixed Mdyn, S0s and Sas with large sizes tend to be younger. Hence, samples selected on the basis of colour or Cr will yield different scalings. Explaining this difference between E and S0 formation is a new challenge for models of early-type galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-{\AA}break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-{\AA}break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109<~M*<~ 3 × 1010Msolar. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.},

	Abstract = {The eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) combines data from ten years of observations with the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide-Field Camera 3 Infra-Red (WFC3/IR) into the deepest image of the sky ever in the optical/near-IR. Since the initial observations on the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) in 2003, numerous surveys and programs, including supernova followup, HUDF09, CANDELS, and HUDF12 have contributed additional imaging data across the HUDF region. Yet these have never been combined and made available as one complete ultra-deep optical and near-infrared image dataset. We do so now for the eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) program. Our new and improved processing techniques provide higher quality reductions of the total dataset. All WFC3 near-IR and optical ACS data sets have been fully combined and accurately matched, resulting in the deepest imaging ever taken at these wavelengths ranging from 29.1 to 30.3 AB mag (5sigma in a 0.35'' diameter aperture) in 9 filters. The gains in the optical for the four filters done in the original ACS HUDF correspond to a typical improvement of 0.15 mag, with gains of 0.25 mag in the deepest areas. Such gains are equivalent to adding ~130 to ~240 orbits of ACS data to the HUDF. Improved processing alone results in a typical gain of ~0.1 mag. Our 5sigma (optical+near-IR) SExtractor catalogs reveal about 14140 sources in the full field and about 7121 galaxies in the deepest part of the XDF (the HUDF09 region). The XDF is the deepest image of the universe ever taken, reaching, in the combined image for a flat f_nu source, to 31.2 AB mag 5sigma (32.9 at 1sigma) in a 0.35'' diameter aperture.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of X-ray scaling laws are critical for improving cosmological constraints derived with the halo mass function and for understanding the physical processes that govern the heating and cooling of the intracluster medium. In this paper, we use a sample of 206 X-ray-selected galaxy groups to investigate the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity (L X) and halo mass (M 200) where M 200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. This work draws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength COSMOS observations including 1.64 degrees2 of contiguous imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys to a limiting magnitude of I F814W = 26.5 and deep XMM-Newton/Chandra imaging to a limiting flux of 1.0 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band. The combined depth of these two data sets allows us to probe the lensing signals of X-ray-detected structures at both higher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. Weak lensing profiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned in luminosity and redshift. The COSMOS data alone are well fit by a power law, M 200 vprop (L X)alpha, with a slope of alpha = 0.66 $\pm$ 0.14. These results significantly extend the dynamic range for which the halo masses of X-ray-selected structures have been measured with weak gravitational lensing. As a result, tight constraints are obtained for the slope of the M-L X relation. The combination of our group data with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the M-L X relation is well described by a single power law, alpha = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.03, over two decades in mass, M 200 ~ 1013.5-1015.5 h -1 72 M sun. These results are inconsistent at the 3.7sigma level with the self-similar prediction of alpha = 0.75. We examine the redshift dependence of the M-L X relation and find little evidence for evolution beyond the rate predicted by self-similarity from z ~ 0.25 to z ~ 0.8.

@article{Lagos.etal.2011a,
	Abstract = {We study the evolution of the cold gas content of galaxies by splitting the interstellar medium into its atomic and molecular hydrogen components, using the galaxy formation model GALFORM in the Lambda cold dark matter framework. We calculate the molecular-to-atomic hydrogen mass ratio, H2/H I, in each galaxy using two different approaches, the pressure-based empirical relation of Blitz & Rosolowsky and the theoretical model of Krumholz, McKeee & Tumlinson, and apply them to consistently calculate the star formation rates of galaxies. We find that the model based on the Blitz & Rosolowsky law predicts an H I mass function, 12CO (1-0) luminosity function, correlations between H2/H I and stellar and cold gas mass, and infrared-12CO molecule luminosity relation in good agreement with local and high-redshift observations. The H I mass function evolves weakly with redshift, with the number density of high-mass galaxies decreasing with increasing redshift. In the case of the H2 mass function, the number density of massive galaxies increases strongly from z= 0 to 2, followed by weak evolution up to z= 4. We also find that H2/H I of galaxies is strongly dependent on stellar and cold gas mass, and also on redshift. The slopes of the correlations between H2/H I and stellar and cold gas mass hardly evolve, but the normalization increases by up to two orders of magnitude from z= 0 to 8. The strong evolution in the H2 mass function and H2/H I is primarily due to the evolution in the sizes of galaxies and, secondarily, in the gas fractions. The predicted cosmic density evolution of H I agrees with the observed evolution inferred from damped Lyalpha systems, and is always dominated by the H I content of low- and intermediate-mass haloes. We find that previous theoretical studies have largely overestimated the redshift evolution of the global H2/H I due to limited resolution. We predict a maximum of ? at z≈ 3.5.},

	Abstract = {Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the ``training-set'' approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking or insufficient-for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the observations-the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There is excellent agreement between the ~130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error of Deltaz~0.06(1+zspec) up to z<6 and no outliers nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above value of Deltaz should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters; the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a method for constructing end-to-end mock galaxy catalogues using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, applied to the halo merger trees extracted from a cosmological N-body simulation. The mocks that we construct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according to the epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, and incorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time. We determine the position between the snapshot outputs at which a galaxy enters the observer's lightcone by interpolation. As an application, we consider the effectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to isolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4 < z < 2.5. The mock catalogue is in reasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as well as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming galaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with KAB <= 23, and 1.4 < z < 2.5, are selected by the BzK technique. Interloper galaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate bright samples of BzK galaxies (i.e. with KAB <= 21). Fainter K-band cuts are necessary to reduce the predicted interloper fraction. We also show that shallow B-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying BzK galaxies as being star forming or passively evolving. Overall, we conclude that the BzK colour selection technique is capable of providing a sample of galaxies that is representative of the 1.4 < z < 2.5 galaxy population.},

	Abstract = {We present new results on the cosmic star formation history in the SXDS-UDS field out to z=1.6. We compile narrow-band data from the Subaru Telescope and the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) in conjunction with broad-band data from the SXDS and UDS, to make a selection of 5725 emission-line galaxies in 12 redshift slices, spanning 10 Gyr of cosmic time. We determine photometric redshifts for the sample using 11-band photometry, and use a spectroscopically confirmed subset to fine tune the resultant redshift distribution. We use the maximum-likelihood technique to determine luminosity functions in each redshift slice and model the selection effects inherent in any narrow-band selection statistically, to obviate the retrospective corrections ordinarily required. The deep narrow-band data are sensitive to very low star formation rates (SFRs), and allow an accurate evaluation of the faint end slope of the Schechter function, alpha. We find that alpha is particularly sensitive to the assumed faintest broadband magnitude of a galaxy capable of hosting an emission line, and propose that this limit should be empirically motivated. For this analysis we base our threshold on the limiting observed equivalent widths of emission lines in the local Universe. We compute the characteristic SFR of galaxies in each redshift slice, and the integrated SFR density, rho_{SFR}. We find our results to be in good agreement with the literature and parametrize the evolution of the SFR density as rho_{SFR} proportional to (1 + z)^{4.58} confirming a steep decline in star formation activity since z = 1.6.},

	Abstract = {The estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize how the galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. If stellar masses can be estimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such as the stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation. We explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fitting broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population models, can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for the star-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dust attenuation curves of galaxies. We apply the observational technique of broad-band SED fitting to model galaxy SEDs calculated by the theoretical galaxy formation model GALFORM, isolating the effect of each of these assumptions. We find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, the common assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does not adversely affect stellar mass estimation. We show that fixing the metallicity in SED fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We find that the common assumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying SED fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ significantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy SEDs offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations.},

	Abstract = {In addition to the large systematic differences arising from assumptions about the stellar mass-to-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar mass function is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the most luminous galaxies. We quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellar mass functions based on SDSS cmodel magnitudes, and PyMorph single-Sersic and Sersic-Exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the SDSS. The PyMorph fits return more light, so that the predicted masses are larger than when cmodel magnitudes are used. As a result, the total stellar mass density at z~0.1 is about 1.2x larger than in our previous analysis of the SDSS. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number density of objects having M* > 6 x 10^{11} Msun is ~5x larger. Alternatively, at number densities of 10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}, the limiting stellar mass is 2x larger. The differences with respect to fits by other authors, typically based on Petrosian-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, although these differences are sometimes masked by large differences in the assumed M*/L (even after scaling to the same IMF). Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly of stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass, so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar mass functions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as well as the binned counts in electronic format.},

	Abstract = {The growth of galaxies is one of the key problems in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe and its constituents. Galaxies can grow their stellar mass by accretion of halo or intergalactic gas clouds, or by merging with smaller or similar mass galaxies. The gas available translates into a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in the universe. The spatially resolved history of their stellar mass assembly has not been obtained so far for any given galaxy beyond the Local Group. Here we demonstrate how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside-out. We report the results from the analysis of the first 105 galaxies of the largest three-dimensional spectroscopic survey to date of galaxies in the local universe (CALIFA). We apply the fossil record method of stellar population spectral synthesis to recover the spatially and time resolved star formation history of each galaxy. We show, for the first time, that the signal of downsizing is spatially preserved, with both inner and outer regions growing faster for more massive galaxies. Further, we show that the relative growth rate of the spheroidal component, nucleus, and inner galaxy, which happened 5-7 Gyr ago, shows a maximum at a critical stellar mass ~7 × 1010 M &sun;. We also find that galaxies less massive than ~1010 M &sun; show a transition to outside-in growth, thus connecting with results from resolved studies of the growth of low-mass galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S{\'e}rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h-1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5<M0.1i<-17.0 mag and 17<mu0.1i<24 mag in 1 arcsec2 [the notation zb represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.

	Abstract = {Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their rest-frame shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands 0.1u, 0.1g, 0.1r, 0.1i, 0.1z with lambdaeff=(3216,4240,5595,6792,8111{\AA}), respectively. To estimate the luminosity function, we use a maximum likelihood method that allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, fits for simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates the flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 expressed in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc3 to be (-14.10+/-0.15, -15.18+/-0.03, -15.90+/-0.03, -16.24+/-0.03, -16.56+/-0.02) in (0.1u, 0.1g, 0.1r, 0.1i,  0.1z), respectively, for a cosmological model with Omega0=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7, and h=1 and using SDSS Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using S{\'e}rsic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the 0.1r band, the best-fit Schechter function to our results has phi*=(1.49+/-0.04)×10-2 h3 Mpc-3, M*-5log10h=-20.44+/-0.01, and alpha=-1.05+/-0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in 0.1r is (1.84+/-0.04)×108 h L0.1r,solar Mpc-3. Our results in the 0.1g band are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (~0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model.  Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

	Abstract = {A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4-8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Omegab = 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has alpha2 ~= -1.6. At masses below ~108.5Msolar, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope, alpha2 ~= -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function -> galaxy baryonic mass function -> GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~1011Msolar corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.},

	Abstract = {Nine determinations of the luminosity function (LF) for field galaxies are adjusted, analyzed, and compared. Adjustments are made for differences in definitions as well as in assumptions regarding magnitude systems, the Hubble constant, and galactic absorption. Eight of the nine adjusted determinations are found to be in fairly good agreement, and the discrepancy in the ninth is attributed to incompleteness effects. A large-scale normalization of the LF is performed using the method and some integral counts of Gott and Turner (1976); the large-scale mean LF of (mostly field) galaxies is found to be about 2.3 times less than a previously derived 'local' LF. The large-scale luminosity density in space arising from sources within the B(0) isophotes of galaxies is evaluated, and a value of 86 million (H/50) suns per cu Mpc is obtained for a galactic absorption coefficient of 0.25 magnitude. It is noted that the true large-scale luminosity density is probably within a factor of 1.6 of the reported value.},

@article{Drory.etal.2009a,
	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of stellar mass functions in the COSMOS field to fainter limits than has been previously probed at z <= 1. The increase in dynamic range reveals features in the shape of the stellar mass function that deviate from a single Schechter function. Neither the total nor the red (passive) or blue (star-forming) galaxy stellar mass functions can be well fitted with a single Schechter function once the mass completeness limit of the sample probes below ~3 × 109 M sun. We observe a dip or plateau at masses ~1010 M sun, just below the traditional M*, and an upturn toward a steep faint-end slope of alpha ~ -1.7 at lower mass at all redshifts <=1. This bimodal nature of the mass function is not solely a result of the blue/red dichotomy. Indeed, the blue mass function is by itself bimodal at z ~ 1. This suggests a new dichotomy in galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence. We propose two interpretations for this bimodal distribution. If the gas fraction increases toward lower mass, galaxies with M baryon ~ 1010 M sun would shift to lower stellar masses, creating the observed dip. This would indicate a change in star formation efficiency, perhaps linked to supernovae feedback becoming much more efficient below ~1010 M sun. Therefore, we investigate whether the dip is present in the baryonic (stars+gas) mass function. Alternatively, the dip could be created by an enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at ~1011 M sun, a phenomenon that naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at M halo ~ 1012 M sun. In this scenario, galaxies occupying the bump around M * would be identified with central galaxies and the second fainter component of the mass function having a steep faint-end slope with satellite galaxies. The low-mass end of the blue and total mass functions exhibit a steeper slope than has been detected in previous work that may increasingly approach the halo mass function value of -2. While the dip feature is apparent in the total mass function at all redshifts, it appears to shift from the blue to the red population, likely as a result of transforming high-mass blue galaxies into red ones. At the same time, we detect a drastic upturn in the number of low-mass red galaxies. Their increase with time seems to reflect a decrease in the number of blue systems and so we tentatively associate them with satellite dwarf (spheroidal) galaxies that have undergone quenching due to environmental processes.},

@article{Pozzetti.etal.2010a,
	Abstract = {We present the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) to redshift z ~= 1, based on the analysis of about 8500 galaxies with I < 22.5 (AB mag) over 1.4 deg2, which are part of the zCOSMOS-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. We investigate the total GSMF, as well as the contributions of early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs, respectively), defined by different criteria (broad-band spectral energy distribution, morphology, spectral properties, or star formation activities). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global GSMF, whose shape is more accurately represented by 2 Schechter functions, one linked to the ETG and the other to the LTG populations. For the global population, we confirm a mass-dependent evolution (``mass-assembly downsizing''), i.e., galaxy number density increases with cosmic time by a factor of two between z = 1 and z = 0 for intermediate-to-low mass (log (M/M&sun;) ~ 10.5) galaxies but less than 15% for log(M/M&sun;) > 11. We find that the GSMF evolution at intermediate-to-low values of M (log (M/M&sun;) < 10.6) is mostly explained by the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation activities, despite the redder colours predicted in particular at low redshift. The low residual evolution is consistent, on average, with ~0.16 merger per galaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major), with a hint of a decrease with cosmic time but not a clear dependence on the mass. From the analysis of different galaxy types, we find that ETGs, regardless of the classification method, increase in number density with cosmic time more rapidly with decreasing M, i.e., follow a top-down building history, with a median ``building redshift'' increasing with mass (z > 1 for log(M/M&sun;) > 11), in contrast to hierarchical model predictions. For LTGs, we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies with log(M/M&sun;) > 10 remains almost constant with cosmic time from z ~ 1. Instead, the most extreme population of star-forming galaxies (with high specific star formation), at intermediate/high-mass, rapidly decreases in number density with cosmic time. Our data can be interpreted as a combination of different effects. Firstly, we suggest a transformation, driven mainly by SFH, from blue, active, spiral galaxies of intermediate mass to blue quiescent and subsequently (1-2 Gyr after) red, passive types of low specific star formation. We find an indication that the complete morphological transformation, probably driven by dynamical processes, into red spheroidal galaxies, occurred on longer timescales or followed after 1-2 Gyr. A continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expected to be accomplished by low-mass active spirals increasing their stellar mass. We estimate the growth rate in number and mass density of the red galaxies at different redshifts and masses. The corresponding fraction of blue galaxies that, at any given time, is transforming into red galaxies per Gyr, due to the quenching of their SFR, is on average ~25% for log(M/M&sun;) < 11. We conclude that the build-up of galaxies and in particular of ETGs follows the same downsizing trend with mass (i.e. occurs earlier for high-mass galaxies) as the formation of their stars and follows the converse of the trend predicted by current SAMs. In this scenario, we expect there to be a negligible evolution of the galaxy baryonic mass function (GBMF) for the global population at all masses and a decrease with cosmic time in the GBMF for the blue galaxy population at intermediate-high masses.

	Abstract = {In the last decade a new generation of telescopes and sensors has allowed the production of a very large amount of data and astronomy has become, a data-rich science; this transition is often labeled as: "data revolution" and "data tsunami". The first locution puts emphasis on the expectations of the astronomers while the second stresses, instead, the dramatic problem arising from this large amount of data: which is no longer computable with traditional approaches to data storage, data reduction and data analysis. In a new, age new instruments are necessary, as it happened in the Bronze age when mankind left the old instruments made out of stone to adopt the new, better ones made with bronze. Everything changed, even the social structure. In a similar way, this new age of Astronomy calls for a new generation of tools and, for a new methodological approach to many problems, and for the acquisition of new skills. The attems to find a solution to this problems falls under the umbrella of a new discipline which originated by the intersection of astronomy, statistics and computer science: Astroinformatics, (Borne, 2009; Djorgovski et al., 2006).},

	Abstract = {I present a model for the star formation properties of z~2 starburst galaxies. Here, I discuss models for the formation of high-z Submillimeter Galaxies, as well as the CO-H2 conversion factor for these systems. I then apply these models to literature observations. I show that when using a functional form for XCO that varies smoothly with the physical properties in galaxies, galaxies at both local and high-z lie on a unimodal Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation law, with power-law index of ~2. The inferred gas fractions of these galaxies are large (fgas ~ 0.2-0.4), though a factor ~2 lower than most literature estimates that utilize locally-calibrated CO-H2 conversion factors.},

	Abstract = {The parameterized extinction data of Fitzpatrick and Massa (1986, 1988) for the ultraviolet and various sources for the optical and near-infrared are used to derive a meaningful average extinction law over the 3.5 micron to 0.125 wavelength range which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium. The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

	Abstract = {Fossil record methods based on spectral synthesis techniques have matured over the past decade, and their application to integrated galaxy spectra fostered substantial advances on the understanding of galaxies and their evolution. Yet, because of the lack of spatial resolution, these studies are limited to a global view, providing no information about the internal physics of galaxies. Motivated by the CALIFA survey, which is gathering Integral Field Spectroscopy over the full optical extent of 600 galaxies, we have developed an end-to-end pipeline which: (i) partitions the observed data cube into Voronoi zones in order to, when necessary and taking due account of correlated errors, increase the S/N, (ii) extracts spectra, including propagated errors and bad-pixel flags, (iii) feeds the spectra into the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, (iv) packs the results for all galaxy zones into a single file, (v) performs a series of post-processing operations, including zone-to-pixel image reconstruction and unpacking the spectral and stellar population properties into multi-dimensional time, metallicity, and spatial coordinates. This paper provides an illustrated description of this whole pipeline and its products. Using data for the nearby spiral NGC 2916 as a show case, we go through each of the steps involved, presenting ways of visualizing and analyzing this manifold. These include 2D maps of properties such as the v-field, stellar extinction, mean ages and metallicities, mass surface densities, star formation rates on different time scales and normalized in different ways, 1D averages in the temporal and spatial dimensions, projections of the stellar light and mass growth (x,y,t) cubes onto radius-age diagrams, etc. The results illustrate the richness of the combination of IFS data with spectral synthesis, providing a glimpse of what is to come from CALIFA and future surveys.

@article{Hearin.Watson.2013a,
	Abstract = {We present age distribution matching, a new theoretical formalism for predicting how galaxies of luminosity L and color C occupy dark matter halos. Our model supposes that there are just two fundamental properties of a halo that determine the color and brightness of the galaxy it hosts: the maximum circular velocity Vmax, and the redshift at which the galaxy will be starved of cold gas z_starve. The halo property z_starve is intended to encompass physical characteristics of a halo's mass assembly history (MAH) that may deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star formation. These include the epochs when: (a) a halo accretes onto a larger halo, z_acc, (b) a halo reaches a characteristic mass (~10^12 Msun/h), z_char, and (c) a halo transitioned from the fast- to slow-accretion regime, z_form. A halo's z_starve value is determined by whichever of these events happens first in its MAH. The new, defining feature of the model is that, at fixed luminosity, galaxy color is in monotonic correspondence with z_starve with the larger values of z_starve being assigned redder colors. We populate the Bolshoi N- body simulation with a mock galaxy catalog based on age distribution matching, and show that the resulting mock galaxy distribution accurately describes the luminosity- and color-binned two-point correlation function of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as a variety of low-redshift galaxy group statistics. Our study of the property z_starve has important implications for how halo MAH influences stellar mass assembly. For example, the significance of the epoch z_form suggests a new, independent channel for so-called "mass quenching" based on the rate of halo mass accretion. We make publicly available our low-redshift, SDSS Mr<-19 mock galaxy catalog, and main progenitor histories of all z=0 Bolshoi halos, at http://logrus.uchicago.edu/~aphearin},

	Abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual & Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 {\AA} range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios.  We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000-{\AA} break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion.},

	Abstract = {In the absence of spectra, fitting template model spectra to observed photometric fluxes, known as Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, has become the workhorse for identifying high-z galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of the most recent and possibly most distant galaxies discovered in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using a more robust method of redshift estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting (MCMC), rather than relying on the redshift of "best fit" models obtained using common chi^2 minimization techniques. The advantage of MCMC fitting is the ability to accurately estimate the probability density function of the redshift, as well as any other input model parameters, allowing us to derive accurate credible intervals by properly marginalizing over all other input model parameters. We apply our method to 13 recently identified sources and show that, despite claims based on chi^2 minimization, none of these sources can be securely ruled out as low redshift interlopers given the low signal-to-noise of currently available observations. We estimate that there is an average probability of 21% that these sources are low redshift interlopers.},

@article{Wilkins.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {Accurate galaxy stellar masses are crucial to better understand the physical mechanisms driving the galaxy formation process. We use synthetic star formation and metal enrichment histories predicted by the GALFORM galaxy formation model to investigate the precision with which various colours (ma - mb) can alone be used as diagnostics of the stellar mass-to-light ratio. As an example, we find that, at z = 0, the intrinsic (Bf435w - Vf606w) colour can be used to determine the intrinsic rest-frame V-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (log 10GammaV = log 10[(M/M&sun;)/(LV/LV&sun;)]) with a precision of sigmalgGamma ~= 0.06 when the initial mass function and redshift are known beforehand. While the presence of dust, assuming a universal attenuation curve, can have a systematic effect on the inferred mass-to-light ratio using a single-colour relation, this is typically small as it is often possible to choose a colour for which the dust reddening vector is approximately aligned with the (ma - mb)-log 10GammaV relation. The precision with which the stellar mass-to-light ratio can be recovered using a single-colour diagnostic rivals implementations of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using more information but in which simple parametrizations of the star formation and metal enrichment histories are assumed. To facilitate the wide use of these relations, we provide the optimal observer frame colour to estimate the stellar mass-to-light ratio, along with the associated parameters, as a function of redshift (0 < z < 1.5) for two sets of commonly used filters.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the emission from a z = 2:35 galaxy that causes damped Lyman-alpha absorption in the spectrum of the background QSO, SDSS J 2222-0946. We present the results of extensive analyses of the stellar continuum covering the rest frame optical-UV regime based on broad-band HST imaging, and of spectroscopy of the strong emission lines: Ly-alpha, [OII], [OIII], [NII], and the H-alpha and H-beta lines from VLT/X-Shooter. We compare the metallicity from the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum with the oxygen abundance inferred from the strong-line methods (R23 and N2). The two emission-line methods yield consistent results: [O/H] = -0.30+/-0.13. Based on the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum a metallicity of -0:52+/-0.05 is inferred at an impact parameter of 6.3 kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The star formation rates of the galaxy from the UV continuum and H-alpha line can be reconciled assuming an amount of reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06+/-0.01, giving an inferred SFR of 13+/-1 M_sun / yr (assuming a Chabrier IMF). From the HST imaging, the galaxy associated with the absorption is found to be a compact (re=1.12 kpc) object with a disclike, elongated (axis ratio 0.17) structure indicating that the galaxy is seen close to edge on. Moreover, the absorbing gas is located almost perpendicularly above the disc of the galaxy suggesting that the gas causing the absorption is not co-rotating with the disc. We investigate the stellar and dynamical masses from SED-fitting and emission-line widths, respectively, and find consistent results of 2x10^9 M_sun. We suggest that the galaxy is a young proto-disc with evidence for a galactic outflow of enriched gas which cools down at a large distance. This galaxy hints at how star-forming galaxies may be linked to the elusive population of damped Lyman-alpha absorbers.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy morphology has many structures that are suggestive of various processes or stages of secular evolution. Internal perturbations such as bars can drive secular evolution through gravity torques that move gas into the central regions and build up a flattened, disk-like central bulge, or which may convert an open spiral pseudoring into a more closed ring. Interaction between individual components of a galaxy, such as between a bar and a dark halo, a bar and a central mass concentration, or between a perturbation and the basic state of a stellar disk, can also drive secular transformations. In this series of lectures, I review many aspects of galaxy morphology with a view to delineating some of the possible evolutionary pathways between different galaxy types.},

	Abstract = {We show that different stellar mass estimation methods yield overall mass scales that disagree by factors up to ~2 for the z=0 galaxy population and, more importantly, relative mass scales that sometimes disagree by factors >~3 between distinct classes of galaxies (spiral/irregular types, classical E/S0s, and E/S0s whose colors reflect recent star formation). This comparison considers stellar mass estimates based on (1) two different calibrations of the correlation between K-band mass-to-light ratio and B-R color and (2) detailed fitting of UBRJHK photometry and optical spectrophotometry using two different population synthesis models (Bruzual-Charlot and Maraston), with the same initial mass function in all cases. We also compare stellar+gas masses with dynamical masses. This analysis offers only weak arguments for preferring a particular stellar mass estimation method, given the plausibility of real variations in dynamical properties and dark matter content. These results help to calibrate the systematic uncertainties inherent in mass-based evolutionary studies of galaxies, including comparisons of low- and high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Existing and future wide-field photometric surveys will produce a time-lapse movie of the sky that will revolutionize our census of variable and moving astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. As with any revolution in scientific measurement capability, this new species of data will also present us with results that are sure to surprise and confound our understanding of the cosmos. While we cannot predict the unknown yields of such endeavors, it is a beneficial exercise to explore certain parameter spaces using reasonable assumptions for rates and observability. To this end I present a simple parameterized model of the detectability of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I also demonstrate that the LSST is well suited to place the first systematic constraints on the rate of UFO and extraterrestrial visits to our world.},

	Abstract = {With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ. This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analyzed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the SDSS main galaxy sample and from the DEEP2 survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.},

	Abstract = {In a probabilistic framework of the interpretation of the initial mass function (IMF), the IMF cannot be arbitrarily normalized to the total mass, M, or number of stars, N, of the system. Hence, the inference of M and N when partial information about the studied system is available must be revised. (i.e., the contribution to the total quantity cannot be obtained by simple algebraic manipulations of the IMF). We study how to include constraints in the IMF to make inferences about different quantities characterizing stellar systems. It is expected that including any particular piece of information about a system would constrain the range of possible solutions. However, different pieces of information might be irrelevant depending on the quantity to be inferred. In this work we want to characterize the relevance of the priors in the possible inferences. Assuming that the IMF is a probability distribution function, we derive the sampling distributions of M and N of the system constrained to different types of information available. We show that the value of M that would be inferred must be described as a probability distribution Phi[M; m_a, N_a, Phi(N)] that depends on the completeness limit of the data, m_a, the number of stars observed down to this limit, N_a, and the prior hypothesis made on the distribution of the total number of stars in clusters, Phi(N).},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of stellar systems depends on the adopted interpretation of the IMF, phi(m). Unfortunately, there is not a common interpretation of the IMF, which leads to different methodologies and diverging analysis of observational data.We study the correlation between the most massive star that a cluster would host, mmax, and its total mass into stars, M, as an example where different views of the IMF lead to different results. We assume that the IMF is a probability distribution function and analyze the mmax-M correlation within this context. We also examine the meaning of the equation used to derive a theoretical M-char_mmax relationship, N x int[Char_mmax-mup] phi(m) dm = 1 with N the total number of stars in the system, according to different interpretations of the IMF. We find that only a probabilistic interpretation of the IMF, where stellar masses are identically independent distributed random variables, provides a self-consistent result. Neither M nor N, can be used as IMF scaling factors. In addition, Char_mmax is a characteristic maximum stellar mass in the cluster, but not the actual maximum stellar mass. A <M>-Char_mmax correlation is a natural result of a probabilistic interpretation of the IMF; however, the distribution of observational data in the N (or M)-cmmax plane includes a dependence on the distribution of the total number of stars, N (and M), in the system, Phi(N), which is not usually taken into consideration. We conclude that a random sampling IMF is not in contradiction to a possible mmax-M physical law. However, such a law cannot be obtained from IMF algebraic manipulation or included analytically in the IMF functional form. The possible physical information that would be obtained from the N (or M)-mmax correlation is closely linked with the Phi(M) and Phi(N) distributions; hence it depends on the star formation process and the assumed.},

	Abstract = {Optical studies of starbursts, AGN and their connections usually leave out galaxies whose emission lines are too weak to warrant reliable measurement and classification. Yet, weak line galaxies abound, and deserve a closer look. We show that these galaxies are either massive, metal rich star-forming systems, or, more often, LINERs. From our detailed stellar population analysis, we find that these LINERs have stopped forming stars long ago. Moreover, their ionizing radiation field is amazingly consistent with that expected from their old stellar populations alone. The black-hole in the centers of these massive, early-type galaxies is not active enough to overwhelm stellar ionization, and thus, despite their looks, they should not be called AGN.},

	Abstract = {We explore the mass-assembly and chemical enrichment histories of star-forming galaxies by applying a population synthesis method to a sample of 84828 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5. Our method decomposes the entire observed spectrum in terms of a sum of simple stellar populations spanning a wide range of ages and metallicities, thus allowing the reconstruction of galaxy histories. A comparative study of galaxy evolution is presented, where galaxies are grouped on to bins of nebular abundances or mass. We find that galaxies whose warm interstellar medium is poor in heavy elements are slow in forming stars. Their stellar metallicities also rise slowly with time, reaching their current values (Z* ~ 1/3Zsolar) in the last ~100 Myr of evolution. Systems with metal-rich nebulae, on the other hand, assembled most of their mass and completed their chemical evolution long ago, reaching Z* ~ Zsolar at lookback times of several Gyr. These same trends, which are ultimately a consequence of galaxy downsizing, appear when galaxies are grouped according to their stellar mass. The reconstruction of galaxy histories to this level of detail out of integrated spectra offers promising prospects in the field of galaxy evolution theories.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique for the determination of the low-mass slope ($\alpha_1$; $M_* < 0.5 M_{\odot}$) of the present day stellar mass function (PDMF) using the pixel space fitting of integrated light spectra. It can be used to constrain the initial mass function (IMF) of stellar systems with relaxation timescales exceeding the Hubble time and testing the IMF universality hypothesis. We provide two versions of the technique: (1) a fully unconstrained determination of the age, metallicity, and $\alpha_1$ and (2) a constrained fitting by imposing the externally determined mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population. We have tested our approach by Monte-Carlo simulations using mock spectra and conclude that: (a) age, metallicity and $\alpha_1$ can be precisely determined by applying the unconstrained version of the code to high signal-to-noise datasets (S/N=100, R=7000 yield $\Delta \alpha_1 \approx 0.1$); (b) the $M/L$ constraint significantly improves the precision and reduces the degeneracies, however its systematic errors will cause biased $\alpha_1$ estimates; (c) standard Lick indices cannot constrain the PDMF because they miss most of the mass function sensitive spectral features; (d) the $\alpha_1$ determination remains unaffected by the high-mass IMF shape ($\alpha_3$; $M_* \ge 1 M_{\odot}$) variation for stellar systems older than 8 Gyr, while the intermediate-mass IMF slope ($\alpha_2$; $0.5 \le M_* < 1 M_{\odot}$) may introduce biases into the best-fitting $\alpha_1$ values if it is different from the canonical value $\alpha_2 = 2.3$. We analysed observed intermediate resolution spectra of ultracompact dwarf galaxies with our technique and demonstrated its applicability to real data.},

	Abstract = {Astrophysics is evolving toward a more rational use of costly observational data by intelligently exploiting the large terrestrial and spatial astronomical databases. In this paper, we present a study showing the suitability of an expert system to perform the classification of stellar spectra in the Morgan and Keenan (MK) system. Using the formalism of artificial intelligence for the development of such a system, we propose a rules' base that contains classification criteria and confidence grades, all integrated in an inference engine that emulates human reasoning by means of a hierarchical decision rules tree that also considers the uncertainty factors associated with rules. Our main objective is to illustrate the formulation and development of such a system for an astrophysical classification problem. An extensive spectral database of MK standard spectra has been collected and used as a reference to determine the spectral indexes that are suitable for classification in the MK system. It is shown that by considering 30 spectral indexes and associating them with uncertainty factors, we can find an accurate diagnose in MK types of a particular spectrum. The system was evaluated against the NOAO-INDO-US spectral catalog.},

	Abstract = {We show that the first 10 eigencomponents of the Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provide a robust classification scheme for the identification of stars, galaxies and quasi-stellar objects from multi-band photometry. To quantify the efficiency of the method, realistic simulations are performed which match the planned Large Zenith Telescope survey. This survey is expected to provide spectral energy distributions with a resolution R =~ 40 for ~ 106 galaxies to R <= 23 (z ~ 1), ~ 104 QSOs, and ~ 105 stars. We calculate that for a median signal-to-noise ratio of 6, 98% of stars, 100% of galaxies and 93% of QSOs are correctly classified. These values increase to 100% of stars, 100% of galaxies and 100% of QSOs at a median signal-to-noise ratio of 10. The 10-component PCA also allows measurement of redshifts with an accuracy of sigmaRes. <~ 0.05 for galaxies with z <~ 0 .7, and to sigmaRes. <~ 0.2 for QSOs with z >~ 2, at a median signal-to-noise ratio of 6. At a median signal-to-noise ratio 20, sigmaRes. <~ 0.02 for galaxies with z <~ 1 and for QSOs with z >~ 2.5 (note that for a median S/N ratio of 20, the bluest/reddest objects will have a signal-to-noise ratio of <~ 2 in their reddest/bluest filters). This redshift accuracy is inherent to the R =~ 40 resolution provided by the set of medium-band filters used by the Large Zenith Telescope survey. It provides an accuracy improvement of nearly an order of magnitude over the photometric redshifts obtained from broad-band BVRI photometry.},

	Abstract = {We perform two-dimensional, point-spread-function-convolved, bulge+disk decompositions in the g and r bandpasses on a sample of 1,123,718 galaxies from the Legacy area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven. Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard SDSS procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics, namely, the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram, and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1 mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of g ~= 19 and r ~= 18.5. We also use and compare three different galaxy fitting models: a pure S{\'e}rsic model, an nb = 4 bulge + disk model, and a S{\'e}rsic (free nb ) bulge + disk model. The most appropriate model for a given galaxy is determined by the F-test probability. All three catalogs of measured structural parameters, rest-frame magnitudes, and colors are publicly released here. These catalogs should provide an extensive comparison set for a wide range of observational and theoretical studies of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new approach to the modeling of the light distribution of galaxies, an orthonormal polar basis formed by a combination of Chebyshev rational functions and Fourier polynomials that we call CHEF functions, or CHEFs. We have developed an orthonormalization process to apply this basis to pixelized images, and implemented the method as a Python pipeline. The new basis displays remarkable flexibility, being able to accurately fit all kinds of galaxy shapes, including irregulars, spirals, ellipticals, highly compact, and highly elongated galaxies. It does this while using fewer components than similar methods, as shapelets, and without producing artifacts, due to the efficiency of the rational Chebyshev polynomials to fit quickly decaying functions like galaxy profiles. The method is linear and very stable, and therefore is capable of processing large numbers of galaxies in a fast and automated way. Due to the high quality of the fits in the central parts of the galaxies, and the efficiency of the CHEF basis modeling galaxy profiles up to very large distances, the method provides highly accurate estimates of total galaxy fluxes and ellipticities. Future papers will explore in more detail the application of the method to perform multiband photometry, morphological classification, and weak shear measurements.},

	Abstract = {We use principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate stellar masses, mean stellar ages, star formation histories (SFHs), dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions for a set of ˜290 000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1011 M&sun; and redshifts in the range 0.4 < z < 0.7 from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We find that the fraction of galaxies with active star formation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens above a stellar mass of 1011.5 M&sun; at z˜ 0.6. This is in striking contrast to z˜ 0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declines monotonically with stellar mass. At stellar masses of 1012 M&sun;, therefore, the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z˜ 0.6 to the present day reaches a factor of ˜10. When we stack the spectra of the most massive, star-forming galaxies at z˜ 0.6, we find that half of their [O III] emission is produced by active galactic nuclei. The black holes in these galaxies are accreting on average at ˜0.01 the Eddington rate. To obtain these results, we use the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual & Charlot to generate a library of model spectra with a broad range of SFHs, metallicities, dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. The PCA is run on this library to identify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range 3700-5500 {\AA}. We demonstrate that linear combinations of these components can recover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the 4000-{\AA} break strength and HdeltaA, with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In addition, the method is able to recover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellar age, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low S/N BOSS spectra. We examine in detail the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the input parameters in our model library, showing that almost all changes result in systematic differences in logM* of 0.1 dex or less. The biggest differences are obtained when using different population synthesis models - stellar masses derived using Maraston et al. models are systematically smaller by up to 0.12 dex at young ages.},

@article{Maraston.etal.2012a,
	Abstract = {We calculate stellar masses for ~400,000 massive luminous galaxies at redshift ~0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow (Delta log M ~0.5 dex) and peaks at about log M/M_sun ~ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over ~ 10^{12} M_{sun}, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above ~ 2.5 10^{11} M_{sun} agrees with previous determinations within 2sigma, but there is a slight offset towards lower number densities in BOSS. This alleviates a tension between the z < 0.1 and the high-redshift mass function. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare well with the BOSS data. However, no evolution is detected from redshift ~ 0.6 to 0 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models.},

	Abstract = {With a primary goal of conducting precision weak-lensing measurements from space, the COSMOS survey has imaged the largest contiguous area observed by Hubble Space Telescope to date, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This is the first paper in a series in which we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak-lensing measurements from COSMOS data. We first construct a source catalog from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg2) subsampled at a pixel scale of 0.03". Defects and diffraction spikes are carefully removed, leaving a total of 1.2×106 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. Multiwavelength follow-up observations of the COSMOS field provide photometric redshifts for 73% of the source galaxies in the lensing catalog. We analyze and discuss the COSMOS redshift distribution and show broad agreement with other surveys to z~1. Our next step is to measure the shapes of galaxies and correct them for the distortion induced by the time-varying ACS point-spread function and for charge transfer efficiency (CTE) effects. Simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in transforming shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. For every galaxy we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that intrinsic shape noise varies little with size, magnitude, or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin2, the final COSMOS weak-lensing catalog contains 3.9×105 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak-lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe the first results of the Advanced Large Homogeneous Area Medium-Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) survey, which provides cosmic tomography of the evolution of the contents of the universe over most of cosmic history. Our novel approach employs 20 contiguous, equal-width, medium-band filters covering from 3500 {\AA} to 9700 {\AA}, plus the standard JHKs near-infrared (NIR) bands, to observe a total area of 4 deg2 on the sky. The optical photometric system has been designed to maximize the number of objects with accurate classification by spectral energy distribution type and redshift, and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission features in the spectrum. The observations are being carried out with the Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope using the wide-field cameras in the optical, Large Area Imager for Calar Alto, and in the NIR, Omega-2000. The first data confirm that we are reaching the expected magnitude limits (for a total of 100 ks integration time per pointing) of AB <= 25 mag (for an unresolved object, signal-to-noise ratio = 5) in the optical filters from the blue to 8300 {\AA}, and from AB = 24.7 to 23.4 for the redder ones. The limit in the NIR, for a total of 15 ks exposure time per pointing, is (in the Vega system) Ks ≈ 20 mag, H≈ 21 mag, J≈ 22 mag. Some preliminary results are presented here to illustrate the capabilities of the ongoing survey. We expect to obtain accurate redshift values, Deltaz/(1 + z) <= 0.03 for about five ×105 galaxies with I <= 25 (60% completeness level), and z med = 0.74. This accuracy, together with the homogeneity of the selection function, will allow for the study of the redshift evolution of the large-scale structure, the galaxy population and its evolution with redshift, the identification of clusters of galaxies, and many other studies, without the need for any further follow-up. It will also provide targets for detailed studies with 10 m class telescopes. Given its area, spectral coverage, and its depth, apart from those main goals, the ALHAMBRA survey will also produce valuable data for galactic studies.

	Abstract = {The work presented in this thesis utilizes the combination of near-IR photometry and spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the stellar masses of distant field galaxies in order to characterize their assembly history since z ~ 1. The primary data set for this analysis comes from an extensive near-IR survey conducted at Palomar Observatory that includes over 12,000 galaxies detected in the K s -band with DEEP2 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.2 < z < 1.5. Utilizing stellar masses estimated for this sample, little evolution is observed in the galaxy stellar mass function since z ~ 1, indicating that the stellar content of intermediate to high-mass galaxies has largely assembled by this epoch. Significant evolution since z ~ 1 in the characteristics of the galaxy population does take place, however. As a function of time, red early- types---already established at the highest masses at z ~ 1---increase in abundance as star formation shifts to late-type galaxies with lower masses, his pattern is interpreted in the context of "downsizing," and a new mechanism is proposed that is capable of quenching star formation in massive galaxies and driving their morphological transformation into systems with spheroidal configurations.  New diagnostics are introduced to quantify this downsizing behavior including the quenching mass, M Q , which traces the stellar mass scale above which star formation in galaxies is suppressed. M Q decreases by a factor of ~5 after z ~ 1, indicating that the quenching mechanism responsible for downsizing becomes more efficient in galaxies with lower masses as a function of time. This evolution is analyzed as a function of environmental density, and no environmental dependence is observed except in the most extreme environments where downsizing appears to be slightly accelerated in high density regions. This weak environmental dependence suggests that the quenching mechanism for most galaxies is primarily driven by internal processes. The nature of the quenching mechanism is discussed in the context of ACDM galaxy formation models, and additional motivation for this comparison is also presented in a direct study of the near-IR merger rate and an analysis of the relationship between stellar mass and dark matter in disk galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present photometric redshifts for the COSMOS survey derived from a new code, optimized to yield accurate and reliable redshifts and spectral types of galaxies down to faint magnitudes and redshifts out to z~1.2. The technique uses chi2 template fitting, combined with luminosity function priors and with the option to estimate the internal extinction [or E(B-V)]. The median most probable redshift, best-fit spectral type and reddening, absolute magnitude, and stellar mass are derived in addition to the full redshift probability distributions. Using simulations with sampling and noise similar to those in COSMOS, the accuracy and reliability is estimated for the photometric redshifts as a function of the magnitude limits of the sample, S/N ratios, and the number of bands used. We find from the simulations that the ratio of derived 95% confidence interval in the chi2 probability distribution to the estimated photometric redshift (D95) can be used to identify and exclude the catastrophic failures in the photometric redshift estimates. To evaluate the reliability of the photometric redshifts, we compare the derived redshifts with high-reliability spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of 868 normal galaxies with z<1.2 from zCOSMOS. Considering different scenarios, depending on using prior, no prior, and/or extinction, we compare the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for this sample. The rms scatter between the estimated photometric redshifts and known spectroscopic redshifts is sigma(Delta(z))=0.031, where Delta(z)=(zphot-zspec)/(1+zspec) with a small fraction of outliers (<2.5%) [outliers are defined as objects with Delta(z)>3sigma(Delta(z)), where sigma(Delta(z)) is the rms scatter in Delta(z)]. We also find good agreement [sigma(Delta(z))=0.10] between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for type II AGNs. We compare results from our photometric redshift procedure with three other independent codes and find them in excellent agreement. We show preliminary results, based on photometric redshifts for the entire COSMOS sample (to i<25 mag).

	Abstract = {We follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral type in the COSMOS 2 deg2 field. We derive the stellar mass functions and stellar mass densities from z = 2 to z = 0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at F 3.6 mum > 1 muJy with accurate photometric redshifts (sigma_{(z_phot-z_spec)/(1+z_spec)}=0.008 at i + < 22.5). Using a spectral classification, we find that z ~ 1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly of quiescent galaxies. Their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex between z = 1.5-2 and z = 0.8-1 (Deltat ~ 2.5 Gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z = 0.8-1 and z ~ 0.1 (Deltat ~ 6 Gyr). Then, we add the morphological information and find that 80%-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log M ˜ 11) have an elliptical morphology at z < 0.8. Therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of star formation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies. Still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a Spi/Irr morphology at low mass (40%-60% at log M˜ 9.5), but this fraction is smaller than predicted by semi-analytical models using a "halo quenching" recipe. We also analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into "intermediate activity" and "high activity" galaxies. We find that the most massive "high activity" galaxies end their high star formation rate phase first. Finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomes lower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z < 1. As a consequence, the rate of "wet mergers" involved in the formation of the most massive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z < 1, which could explain the observed slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

At z < 0.46, where Halpha and [N II] are detected, we find the same dependence of metallicity on stellar mass and star formation rate, the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), found by Mannucci et al. in Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies on a similar redshift range. We extend this relation to higher redshift, 0.49 < z < 0.8, where the R23 metallicity index can be measured in our data, finding no evidence for evolution, and a metallicity scatter around the relation of about 0.16 dex. This result confirms, with a much higher level of significance with respect to previous works, the absence of evolution of the FMR during the last-half of cosmic history.},

	Abstract = {In the study of galaxy integrated light, if photometric indicators could extract age and metallicity information of high enough quality, photometry might be vastly more efficient than spectroscopy for the same astrophysical goals. Towards this end, we search three photometric systems: David Dunlap Observatory, Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut and Str{\"o}mgren systems for their ability to disentangle age and abundance effects. Only the Str{\"o}mgren [c1] versus [m1] plot shows moderate age-metallicity disentanglement. We also add to the discussion of optical to near-infrared Johnson-Cousins broad-band colours, finding a great decrease in age sensitivity when updated isochrones are used.},

	Abstract = {In the coming years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data to estimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5 optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, but strongly reduce the total system throughput. We explore how photometric redshift performance depends on the number of filters nf , characterizing the survey depth by the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshift estimates. For a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging area of 270 hr m2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both in completeness depth and precision, than systems with nf gsim 8 filters. Our results suggest that for low nf the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm the improvements in photometric depth, and that even at higher nf the effective photometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width than naively expected from the reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. Adding near-IR observations improves the performance of low-nf systems, but still the system which maximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by nine filters with logarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-band overlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5 filter systems. A system with 20 constant-width, nonoverlapping filters reaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precision almost three times better, deltaz = 0.014(1 + z) versus deltaz = 0.042(1 + z). We briefly discuss a practical implementation of such a photometric system: the ALHAMBRA Survey.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive elliptical galaxies have total mass density profiles within an effective radius that can be approximated as \rho_{tot}\propto r^{-\gamma'}, with mean slope <\gamma'>=2.08 \pm 0.03 and scatter \sigma_\gamma'=0.16 \pm 0.02. The small scatter of the slope (known as the bulge-halo conspiracy) is not generic in LCDM based models and therefore contains information about the galaxy formation process. We compute the distribution of \gamma' for LCDM-based models that reproduce the observed correlations between stellar mass, velocity dispersion, and effective radius of early-type galaxies in the SDSS. The models have a range of stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) and dark halo responses to galaxy formation. The observed distribution of \gamma' is well reproduced by a model with cosmologically motivated but uncontracted dark matter haloes, and a Salpeter-type IMF. Other models are on average ruled out by the data, even though they may happen in individual cases. Models with adiabatic halo contraction (and lighter IMFs) predict too small values of \gamma'. Models with halo expansion, or mass-follows-light predict too high values of \gamma'. Our study shows that the non-homologous structure of massive early-type galaxies can be precisely reproduced by LCDM models if the IMF is not universal and if mechanisms such as feedback from active galactic nuclei, or dynamical friction, effectively on average counterbalance the contraction of the halo expected as a result of baryonic cooling.},

@article{Johnston.etal.2012a,
	Abstract = {A new method for spectroscopic bulge-disc decomposition is presented, in which the spatial light profile in a two-dimensional spectrum is decomposed wavelength by wavelength into bulge and disc components, allowing separate one-dimensional spectra for each component to be constructed. This method has been applied to observations of a sample of nine lenticular galaxies (S0s) in the Fornax Cluster in order to obtain clean high-quality spectra of their individual bulge and disc components. So far this decomposition has only been fully successful when applied to galaxies with clean light profiles, without contamination from dust lanes, etc. This has consequently limited the number of galaxies that could be separated into bulge and disc components. The Lick index stellar population analysis of the component spectra reveals that in those galaxies where the bulge and disc could be distinguished, the bulges have systematically higher metallicities and younger stellar populations than the discs. This correlation is consistent with a picture in which S0 formation comprises the shutting down of star formation in the disc accompanied by a final burst of star formation in the bulge. Similarly, a trend was found to exist whereby galaxies with younger stellar populations have higher metallicities. The variation in spatial-fit parameters with wavelength also allows us to measure approximate colour gradients in the individual components. Such gradients were detected separately in both bulges and discs, in the sense that redder light is systematically more centrally concentrated in all components. However, a search for radial variations in the absorption line strengths determined for the individual components revealed that, although they can be sensitively detected where present, they are absent from the vast majority of S0 discs and bulges. The absence of gradients in line indices for most galaxies implies that the colour gradient cannot be attributed to age or metallicity variations and is therefore most likely associated with varying degrees of obscuration by dust.},

	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z=0-1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i<23 flux-limited sample of ~40,000 galaxies at z=0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ~5.5 deg^2, and from the SDSS we select ~170,000 galaxies at z=0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ~30% increase in the number density of ~10^10 Msun galaxies since z~0.6, and a <10% change in the number density of all >10^11 Msun galaxies since z~1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star-formation rate, we find that the number density of ~10^10 Msun star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z~0.6, whereas the space-density of >10^11 Msun star-forming galaxies decreases by ~50% between z~1 and z~0. Meanwhile, the number density of ~10^10 Msun quiescent galaxies increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of ~2-3 since z~0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z~1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ~10^10.8 Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z<1, even among massive (>10^11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We report results of a population synthesis model that follows the evolution of single and binary stars. In this model we include the 2HeWD merger channel, suggested by Han et al. (2002), for the formation of EHB stars. The physical parameters of the resulting EHB stars are derived from the BaSTI database, and are thus realistic and observationally supported. The predictions of this model are in good agreement with traditional population synthesis models, except when the spectrum of the stellar population is dominated by binary stars or their products, e.g., EHB stars in the UV of ETGs. We reproduce successfully the observed CMD and SED of the metal rich open cluster NGC 6791. The stellar population in this cluster may be archetypal of the stellar population in ETGs that show the UVX phenomenon. Our models should be appropriate to study the UV upturn in ETGs.},

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.},

	Abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

@article{Kauffmann.etal.2003a,
	Abstract = {We study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size and internal structure for a complete sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3 × 1010 Msolar. Lower-mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion sigma(lnR50) ~ 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as mu*~M0.54*, suggesting that the stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 × 1010 Msolar, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

@article{Pozzetti.etal.2007a,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) of galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). Our survey offers the possibility to investigate the GSMF using two different samples: (1) an optical (I-selected 17.5 <I_AB<24) main spectroscopic sample of about 6500 galaxies over 1750 arcmin2 and (2) a near-IR (K-selected K_AB<22.34~and~K_AB<22.84) sample of about 10 200 galaxies, with photometric redshifts accurately calibrated on the VVDS spectroscopic sample, over 610 arcmin^2. We apply and compare two different methods to estimate the stellar mass M_stars from broad-band photometry based on different assumptions about the galaxy star-formation history. We find that the accuracy of the photometric stellar mass is satisfactory overall, and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%) stellar masses. We derive the cosmic evolution of the GSMF, the galaxy number density and the stellar mass density in different mass ranges. At low redshift (z~=0.2) we find a substantial population of low-mass galaxies (<10^9~M_&sun;) composed of faint blue galaxies (M_I-MK ~= 0.3). In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z˜0.9 and more rapidly above this redshift, in particular for low mass systems. Conversely, a massive population is present up to z=2.5 and has extremely red colours (M_I-M_K~= 0.7-0.8). We find a decline with redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59$\pm$5% for M_stars > 10^8~M_&sun; at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution (``mass-downsizing''). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible (<30%) evolution up to z˜0.7 for massive galaxies (>6×1010~M_&sun;). For less massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. Specifically, a large fraction (>=50%) of massive galaxies have been assembled and converted most of their gas into stars at z˜1, ruling out ``dry mergers'' as the major mechanism of their assembly history below z~=1. This fraction decreases to ˜33% at z˜2. Low-mass systems have decreased continuously in number density (by a factor of up to 4.1$\pm$0.9) from the present age to z=2, consistent with a prolonged mass assembly also at z<1. The evolution of the stellar mass density is relatively slow with redshift, with a decrease of a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.1 at z=1 and about 4.5$\pm$0.3 at z=2.5.  Based on data obtained with the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, Paranal, Chile, program 070.A-9007(A), and on data obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, operated by the CNRS of France, CNRC in Canada and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {We present stellar mass surface density profiles of a mass-selected sample of 177 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 2.5, obtained using very deep Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-infrared data over the GOODS-South field, including recent CANDELS data. Accurate stellar mass surface density profiles have been measured for the first time for a complete sample of high-redshift galaxies more massive than 1010.7 M &sun;. The key advantage of this study compared to previous work is that the surface brightness profiles are deconvolved for point-spread function smoothing, allowing accurate measurements of the structure of the galaxies. The surface brightness profiles account for contributions from complex galaxy structures such as rings and faint outer disks. Mass profiles are derived using radial rest-frame ug color profiles and a well-established empirical relation between these colors and the stellar mass-to-light ratio. We derive stellar half-mass radii from the mass profiles, and find that these are on average ~25% smaller than rest-frame g-band half-light radii. This average size difference of 25% is the same at all redshifts, and does not correlate with stellar mass, specific star formation rate, effective surface density, S{\'e}rsic index, or galaxy size. Although on average the difference between half-mass size and half-light size is modest, for approximately 10% of massive galaxies this difference is more than a factor of two. These extreme galaxies are mostly extended, disk-like systems with large central bulges. These results are robust, but could be impacted if the central dust extinction becomes high. ALMA observations can be used to explore this possibility. These results provide added support for galaxy growth scenarios wherein massive galaxies at these epochs grow by accretion onto their outer regions.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Understanding how galaxies evolve and assemble their mass across cosmic time is still a fundamental, unsolved issue. To get insight into the various processes of galaxy mass assembly, the Mass Assembly Survey with SINFONI in VVDS (MASSIV) aims at probing the kinematical and chemical properties of a significant and representative sample of high-redshift (0.9 <= z <= 1.8) star-forming galaxies.  Methods: This paper presents the selection function, the observing strategy, and the global properties of the MASSIV sample. This sample contains 84 star-forming galaxies, selected from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and observed with the SINFONI integral-field spectrograph at the VLT. We present the redshift distribution, and derive the stellar masses and SED-based star formation rates (SFR). Integrated metallicities and the presence of type-2 AGNs are investigated using composite 1D spectra built from VIMOS and SINFONI observations.  Results: The MASSIV selection function, based on star formation criteria ([O ii]lambda3727 emission-line strength up to z ~ 1.5 and colors/UV absorption lines at higher redshifts), provides a good representation of "normal" star-forming galaxies with SED-based SFRs between 5 and 400 M&sun; yr-1 in the stellar mass regime 109 - 1011 M&sun;. Analysis of typical emission-line ratios performed on composite spectra reveals that the contamination by type-2 AGNs is very low and that the integrated metallicity of the galaxies follows the well-known mass-metallicity relation.  Conclusions: The MASSIV sample has been built upon a simple selection function, fully representative of the star-forming galaxy population at 0.9 < z < 1.8 for SFR >= 5 M&sun; yr-1. Together with the size of the sample, the spatially-resolved SINFONI data therefore enables us to discuss global, volume averaged, galaxy kinematic, and chemical properties across the full mass and SFR range of the survey to derive robust conclusions for galaxy mass assembly on cosmological timescales.

@article{CidFernandes.etal.2010b,
	Abstract = {A numerous population of weak line galaxies (WLGs) is often left out of statistical studies on emission-line galaxies (ELGs) due to the absence of an adequate classification scheme, since classical diagnostic diagrams, such as [OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha (the BPT diagram), require the measurement of at least four emission lines. This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the usual divisory lines between star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts and between Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More specifically, (1) we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280000 ELGs, one-third of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al., Kauffmann et al. and Stasinska et al. to distinguish SF galaxies and AGN hosts and Kewley et al. to distinguish Seyferts from LINERs. (3) We transpose these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/Halpha as a horizontal axis, but replacing Hbeta by a stronger line (Halpha or [OII]), or substituting the ionization-level sensitive [OIII]/Hbeta ratio with the equivalent width of Halpha (WHalpha). Optimized equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow one to classify up to 50 per cent more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of galaxies in the local Universe increases the proportion of metal-rich SF galaxies and especially LINERs.  In the course of this analysis, we were led to make the following points. (i) The Kewley et al. BPT line for galaxy classification is generally ill-used. (ii) Replacing [OIII]/Hbeta by WHalpha in the classification introduces a change in the philosophy of the distinction between LINERs and Seyferts, but not in its results. Because the WHalpha versus [NII]/Halpha diagram can be applied to the largest sample of ELGs without loss of discriminating power between Seyferts and LINERs, we recommend its use in further studies. (iii) The dichotomy between Seyferts and LINERs is washed out by WLGs in the BPT plane, but it subsists in other diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that the right wing in the BPT diagram is indeed populated by at least two classes, tentatively identified with bona fide AGN and `retired' galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their old stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the bimodal distribution of the galaxy population commonly seen in the local universe. Here, we address the bimodality observed in galaxy properties in terms of spectral synthesis products, such as mean stellar ages and stellar masses, derived from the application of this powerful method to a volume-limited sample, with magnitude limit cut-off M(r) = -20.5, containing about 50000 luminous galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2 (DR2). In addition, galaxies are classified according to their emission-line properties in three distinct spectral classes: star-forming galaxies, with young stellar populations; passive galaxies, dominated by old stellar populations; and hosts of active nuclei, which comprise a mix of young and old stellar populations. We show that the extremes of the distribution of some galaxy properties, essentially galaxy colours, 4000 {\AA} break index and mean stellar ages, are associated to star-forming galaxies at one side, and passive galaxies at another. We find that the mean light-weighted stellar age of galaxies is directly responsible for the bimodality seen in the galaxy population. The stellar mass, in this view, has an additional role since most of the star-forming galaxies present in the local universe are low-mass galaxies. Our results also give support to the existence of a `downsizing' in galaxy formation, where massive galaxies seen nowadays have stellar populations formed at early times.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the bimodal distribution of the galaxy population commonly  seen in the local universe. Here we address the bimodality observed in  galaxy properties in terms of spectral synthesis products, such as mean  stellar ages and stellar masses, derived from the application of this  powerful method to a sample of spectra extracted from the Sloan Digital  Sky Survey. We apply the spectral synthesis approach presented in Cid  Fernandes et al. (2005) to a volume-limited sample, with magnitude limit  cutoff M(r) = -20.5, containing about 50 thousand luminous galaxies from  the SDSS Data Release 2. We obtain, for each galaxy, the mean age of  their stars, the stellar mass and the stellar extinction. In addition,  galaxies are classified according to their emission line properties in  three distinct spectral classes: star-forming galaxies (with young  stellar populations), passive galaxies (dominated by old stellar  populations), and hosts of active nuclei. We show that the extremes of  the distribution of some galaxy properties- essentially galaxy colours,  4000A break index, and mean stellar ages- are associated to star-forming  galaxies at one side, and passive galaxies at another. We show that the  mean light-weighted stellar age of galaxies presents the best  description of the bimodality seen in the galaxy population. The stellar  mass, in this view, has an additional role since most of the  star-forming galaxies present in the local universe are low-mass  galaxies. Our results also give support to the existence of a  `downsizing' in galaxy formation, where massive galaxies seen nowadays  have stellar populations formed at early times. seen nowadays have  stellar populations formed at early times. Discussion. Our analysis  allows to demonstrate that the bimodality of the galaxy population,  commonly seen in colour-magnitude diagrams is related to the presence of  a young and luminous stellar component in galaxies currently undergoing  star formation, in contrast with the stellar content of passive  galaxies, where old stars are the responsible for most of their  luminosities. We also show that AGN-hosts have intermediate properties  between star-forming and passive galaxies.},

@article{Asari.etal.2007a,
	Abstract = {This paper, the sixth in the Semi-Empirical Analysis of Galaxies series, studies the evolution of 82302 star-forming (SF) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Star formation histories (SFHs) are derived from detailed spectral fits obtained with our publicly available spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT. Our main goals are to explore new ways to derive SFHs from the synthesis results and apply them to investigate how SFHs vary as a function of nebular metallicity (Zneb). A number of refinements over our previous work are introduced, including (1) an improved selection criterion; (2) a careful examination of systematic residuals around Hbeta (3) self-consistent determination of nebular extinctions and metallicities; (4) tests with several Zneb estimators; (5) a study of the effects of the reddening law adopted and of the relation between nebular and stellar extinctions and the interstellar component of the NaI D doublet.  Our main achievements may be summarized as follows. (1) A conventional correlation analysis is performed to study how global properties relate to Zneb, leading to the confirmation of previously known relations, such as those between Zneb and galaxy luminosity, mass, dust content, mean stellar metallicity and mean stellar age. (2) A simple formalism which compresses the results of the synthesis while at the same time yielding time-dependent star formation rates (SFR) and mass assembly histories is presented. (3) A comparison of the current SFR derived from the population synthesis with that obtained from Halpha shows that these independent estimators agree very well, with a scatter of a factor of 2. An important corollary of this finding is that we now have a way to estimate SFR in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei, where the Halpha method cannot be applied. (4) Fully time-dependent SFHs were derived for all galaxies, and then averaged over six Zneb bins spanning the entire SF wing in the diagram. (5) We find that SFHs vary systematically along the SF sequence. Though all SF galaxies formed the bulk of their stellar mass over 1 Gyr ago, low-Zneb systems evolve at a slower pace and are currently forming stars at a much higher relative rate. Galaxies at the tip of the SF wing have current specific SFRs about two orders of magnitude larger than the metal-rich galaxies at its bottom. (6) At any given time, the distribution of specific SFRs for galaxies within a Zneb bin is broad and approximately lognormal. (7) The whole study was repeated grouping galaxies within bins of stellar mass and surface mass density, both of which are more fundamental drivers of SFH. Given the existence of strong Zneb - M* - Sigma* relations, the overall picture described above remains valid. Thus, low-M* (low-Sigma*) systems are the ones which evolve slower, with current specific SFRs much larger than more massive (dense) galaxies. (8) This overall pattern of SFHs as a function of Zneb,M* or Sigma* is robust against changes in selection criteria, choice of evolutionary synthesis models for the spectral fits, and differential extinction effects.},

	Abstract = {The classification of galaxies as star forming or active is generally done in the ([OIII]/Hbeta, [NII]/Halpha) plane. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has revealed that, in this plane, the distribution of galaxies looks like the two wings of a seagull. Galaxies in the right wing are referred to as Seyfert/LINERs, leading to the idea that non-stellar activity in galaxies is a very common phenomenon. Here, we argue that a large fraction of the systems in the right wing could actually be galaxies which stopped forming stars. The ionization in these `retired' galaxies would be produced by hot post-asymptotic giant branch stars and white dwarfs. Our argumentation is based on a stellar population analysis of the galaxies via our STARLIGHT code and on photoionization models using the Lyman continuum radiation predicted for this population. The proportion of LINER galaxies that can be explained in such a way is, however, uncertain. We further show how observational selection effects account for the shape of the right wing. Our study suggests that nuclear activity may not be as common as thought. If retired galaxies do explain a large part of the seagull's right wing, some of the work concerning nuclear activity in galaxies, as inferred from SDSS data, will have to be revised.},

	Abstract = {Retrieving the Star Formation History (SFH) of a galaxy out of its integrated spectrum is the central goal of stellar population synthesis. Recent advances in evolutionary synthesis models have given new breath to this old field of research. Modern spectral synthesis techniques incorporating these advances now allow the fitting of galaxy spectra on an {\AA}-by-{\AA}. These detailed fits are useful for a number of studies, like emission line, stellar kinematics, and specially galaxy evolution. Applications of this semi-empirical approach to mega data sets are teaching us a lot about the lives of galaxies. The STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code is one of the tools which allows one to harness this favorable combination of plentifulness of data and models. To illustrate this, we show how SFHs vary across classical emission line diagnostic diagrams. Systematic trends are present along both the star-forming and active-galaxy sequences. We also briefly describe experiments with new versions of evolutionary synthesis models. Last but not least, we announce the public availability of both STARLIGHT and a database of detailed spectral fits and related products for over half a million galaxies from the SDSS. This facility allows more physically inspired explorations of the parameter space than is possible in terms of raw observed properties, offering new ways to navigate through the realm of galaxies.},

Yet, weak line galaxies abound, and deserve a closer look. We show that these galaxies are either massive, metal rich star-forming systems, or, more often, LINERs. From our detailed stellar population analysis, we find that these LINERs have stopped forming stars long ago. Moreover, their ionizing radiation field is amazingly consistent with that expected from their old stellar populations alone.  The black-hole in the centers of these massive, early-type galaxies is not active enough to overwhelm stellar ionization, and thus, despite their looks, they should not be called AGN.},

	Abstract = {During the last three decades, many papers have reported the existence of a luminosity metallicity or mass metallicity (M-Z) relation for all kinds of galaxies: The more massive galaxies are also the ones with more metal-rich interstellar medium. We have obtained the mass-metallicity relation at different lookback times for the same set of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using the stellar metallicities estimated with our spectral synthesis code starlight. Using stellar metallicities has several advantages: We are free of the biases that affect the calibration of nebular metallicities; we can include in our study objects for which the nebular metallicity cannot be measured, such as AGN hosts and passive galaxies; we can probe metallicities at different epochs of a galaxy evolution.  We have found that the M-Z relation steepens and spans a wider range in both mass and metallicity at higher redshifts for SDSS galaxies. We also have modeled the time evolution of stellar metallicity with a closed-box chemical evolution model, for galaxies of different types and masses.

	Abstract = {Massive spectroscopic surveys like the SDSS have revolutionized the way we study AGN and their relations to the galaxies they live in. A first step in any such study is to define samples of different types of AGN on the basis of emission-line ratios. This deceivingly simple step involves decisions on which classification scheme to use and data quality censorship. Galaxies with weak emission lines are often left aside or dealt with separetely because one cannot fully classify them onto the standard star-forming, Seyfert, or LINER categories. This contribution summarizes alternative classification schemes which include this very numerous population. We then study how star-formation histories and physical properties of the hosts vary from class to class, and present compelling evidence that the emission lines in the majority of LINER-like systems in the SDSS are not powered by black-hole accretion. The data are fully consistent with them being galaxies whose old stars provide all the ionizing power needed to explain their line ratios and luminosities. Such retired galaxies deserve a place in the emission-line taxonomy.},

	Abstract = {Various studies have shown that there is an empirical relation between the nebular metallicity of a galaxy and its stellar mass. Until now, most studies of the mass-metallicity relation (M-Z) have focused on the abundances of the interstellar medium as measured by emission-line features. This technique thus excludes galaxies with AGN from the working samples, due to the difficulty to measure the nebular abundances when emission-lines are powered both by stars and AGN. With our synthesis code starlight, we are able to recover the stellar metallicities of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Therefore, although we still cannot measure the nebular metallicity in AGN hosts, we know their present-day stellar metallicities. Moreover, because we measure the metallicity of stellar populations of different ages in a galaxy, we are also able also recover the history of its chemical enrichment.},

	Abstract = {We will present preliminary results of the occultation of Tycho star 6833-00163-1 by the dwarf-planet 1 Ceres. The 11.8 visual magnitude star was occulted in the night of 17 August 2010, with the shadow passing through south, south-east and central part of Brazil. The observation was a challenge because of the drop in magnitude was only 0.07 for a visual magnitude of 8.4 foreseen for Ceres at the time of the occultation. We obtained data from five sites, with successful detections of the event from four of them. Occultation chords span from the extreme north portion of the asteroid to the south of it. As this is a recent event, analysis is still in progress. Preliminary results will be presented on Ceres' radius, and possibly, on its oblateness.},

	Abstract = {Between February 2010 and May 2011, our group has observed five stellar occultations by Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), giving the size and shape for some of the biggest TNO's: Varuna, Eris, 2003 AZ84, Makemake and Quaoar. Here we present two of them: the January 08 stellar occultation by 2003 AZ84, and the May 04 by Quaoar. For the event of 2003 AZ84 we obtained one positive and another negative occultation chords in Chile. We give a lower limit to the diameter of the TNO. The event of Quaoar was observed from 16 sites distributed in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil. Five of them yielded positive detection of the occultation. A preliminary analysis shows that the body is probably elongated and significantly bigger than the size determined by Fraser & Brown 2010, with a diameter of 890km. Using the size determined by the occultation, we will discuss the implications for the body density and albedo determination. The upper limit of the atmosphere is also studied.},

@inproceedings{YanesDiaz.etal.2012a,
	Abstract = {There are many ways to solve the challenging problem of making a high performance robotic observatory from scratch. The Observatorio Astrof{\'\i}sico de Javalambre (OAJ) is a new astronomical facility located in the Sierra de Javalambre (Teruel, Spain) whose primary role will be to conduct all-sky astronomical surveys. The OAJ control system has been designed from a global point of view including astronomical subsystems as well as infrastructures and other facilities. Three main factors have been considered in the design of a global control system for the robotic OAJ: quality, reliability and efficiency. We propose CIA (Control Integrated Architecture) design and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) as a key performance indicator in order to improve operation processes, minimizing resources and obtaining high cost reduction whilst maintaining quality requirements. The OAJ subsystems considered for the control integrated architecture are the following: two wide-field telescopes and their instrumentation, active optics subsystems, facilities for sky quality monitoring (seeing, extinction, sky background, sky brightness, cloud distribution, meteorological station), domes and several infrastructure facilities such as water supply, glycol water, water treatment plant, air conditioning, compressed air, LN2 plant, illumination, surveillance, access control, fire suppression, electrical generators, electrical distribution, electrical consumption, communication network, Uninterruptible Power Supply and two main control rooms, one at the OAJ and the other remotely located in Teruel, 40km from the observatory, connected through a microwave radio-link. This paper presents the OAJ strategy in control design to achieve maximum quality efficiency for the observatory processes and operations, giving practical examples of our approach.},
